It's still heterosexuality though? Also something something I'm pretty sure. calling someone a rapist is against the sub rules but what do I know. Very sensible and sensitive thing to say to someone who for all you know could have been a rape survivor - seeing as trans teens have about double the risk of rape or forced sex or sexual violence in high school than cis girls...

I totally agree on the point that the views of the Kashmiris were not considered and whole of the Kashmir was kept under a close eye before passing this decision.  This should be a welcome move as now Kashmir will be truly a part of India. It will work in similar fashion as other UT such as Delhi, Pondicherry, etc are working. Now India is open to Kashmiris and Kashmir is truly open to India. I would suggest all to wait and then react as this can turn out to be positive for all the region.

It's just really pointless and insulting to people who actually experience racism by implying our society is in need of a reminder that being a white person is okay. Because I doubt one genuine look at history would leave anyone wondering if "being white" in the U.S. will be perceived as a problem.  The very concept of on a personal level being okay with the fact you were born with the skin color you were born with is of course not racist. But the statement just makes it seem like white people are at risk to become some sort of outcasts.

Dating-wise, I actually think being a lesbian is beneficial in some ways. If I were dating guys, I'd constantly be worried they were fetishizing me for my race. With girls I don't worry about that at all. Biggest problems in general are probably family dynamics. Even tho my family is fairly progressive, I don't plan on coming out anytime soon.

It takes belief in false morality to commit atrocities. Those who believe in the false morality of anti-abortion, anti-gay religions are primed for authoritarianism. They use their beliefs to prop themselves up as superior to others. They excuse all transgressions made by hose who share their beliefs. That is how they excuse the obvious and undeniable immorality of Trump. It is only a small step from there to dehumanizing others and committing genocidal acts like separating migrant children from their parents or ignoring the threat of climate change.

Its exactly like coming out of the closet. Once it's out, it can't go back in. Life long friendships will become surprisingly strained and awkward. Family members will hold you at bay and think you're mental. But others will leap out to support you in surprising ways. Like when someone comes out as gay, there's some story like "Oh, you know your Uncle Charlie was gay, but different times then." And people will share with you, and in the end I find that's it more rewarding personally. Like being who you were put on earth to be.

This is fucking groundbreaking for representation today. The only quip I have is that it's kinda implying that non-binary people are women too? Like the point of they-series pronouns is to not be identified as male or female. But also that's a really difficult line, if you grew up being gendered as a woman then you still had to put up with the struggles of being a woman in society

Yeah, it's just a solid how to be a good date and how to be a decent trans ally 101. I'll keep that in mind, but I'm really not the best person to write an article on dating a trans person. I do have one of my sexy friends who's a trans guy though. Still don't feel qualified. :P

It's just really pointless and insulting to people who actually experience racism by implying our society is in need of a reminder that being a white person is okay. Because I doubt one genuine look at history would leave anyone wondering if "being white" in the U.S. will be perceived as a problem.  The very concept of on a personal level being okay with the fact you were born with the skin color you were born with is of course not racist. But the statement just makes it seem like white people are at risk to become some sort of outcasts.

The Lord Krishna of India had very dark skin. He is an avatar of the sustaining forces of the God head; Lord Vishnu. He is depicted as having dark to black blue skin. He is revered by nearly 1.5 billion people. He is the epitome of Karmic fairness. The upholder of duty and dharma. The line up itself was not bias free. Personally, I don't think skin color matter all that much.

Copts are Oriental Orthodox, not Eastern Orthodox. Granted, do have a few Copts here, because the two traditions are close enough that Oriental Orthodox often post on Eastern Orthodox forums. However, matters of who parishioners can marry or not is so dependent on the local priest, that strangers on the internet will be of little help and you really need to get her priest's input.

Yes, in barbaric, authoritarian cultures that have since been condemned. Interesting that Christians desire to perpetuate the same idea.
Man, I'm Latino and had married a Pakistani. I think that's a much wider cultural divide, but we were able to bridge it. It just takes mutual understanding, respect, and (in some cases) standing up to your family.  If your mother doesn't want to get along with this woman because she's Bengali, your mother is making a conscious choice. You have to love and respect your mother, but she's totally wrong with the idea that your cultures are incompatible or something. Bengalis are also delightful.

That's just not fair. Poverty and poor families are ever where If your poor and down on your luck it's just the hand your dealt Black or White I wouldn't be so quick to blame others. Everyone has to pick themselves up Without blames or excuses. What's next ? If a race was known to have a certain sickness than others. What ? Are they going to blame them for that to ? Being poor or rich isn't supposed to happen to certain people What ever you end up being one only hopes and prays everyone is capable of doing the best you can do
You can have a physical or sexual attraction for men without being fully gay. Sexuality is a huge spectrum. Me and my husband are both bi, but we have children and a very conventional looking life and relationship. Life isn't black and white, and you don't need to be so worried and consumed with the grey areas. Just work on being the best you possible and accepting yourself for who you are.

Sentimental problems. Because let's be real. I never meet a girl that was able to give me the right advice with another girl. Anyway. Except this personal inconvenient, I am more open to share information with woman then males. The point is that I usually notice that woman take care about what is my point of view, and they understand not only what I'm saying, but why I'm saying. With males the conversation is a bit different, and I feel like I don't like share too much of myself. So I can defiantly say that what I share with male, I share with female.
Men are still ten times more likely to die on the job. As we get more "equality", I don't see women taking dangerous jobs from men. Women are taking safe jobs from men so even more men will die on the job. If we were to have a another Vietnam (60,000 killed), 97% will be men. Men die earlier than women, but spending on woman's healthcare research (breast, ovarian cancer etc.) is four (4) times greater than the sending on mens healthcare research (prostate, testicular cancer etc.). The list goes on.

That's definitely true. My main point was that Koreans brought Christianity over, so it was an organic movement. A lot of people make a distinction between 'Christians' and 'Catholics'. I've sat through sermons in Protestant churches where the pastor credits foreign missionaries with bringing Christianity to Korea. There is a lot of whitewashing and cover up of the true history. Even Protestants put their own spin on it.

It's no big deal being biracial. I Have 5 biracial grandchildren (Hispanic/Caucasian. As a Caucasian grandmother, when I look at my grandchildren I see my grandchildren, not a race. If my grandchildren were African-American/Caucasian I would only see my grandchildren, not a race.

Which kind of curls are you talking? The beautiful 3C that is glorify by the media or the short 4c? Black girls have different type of curls. That is why to protect them we wear protective styles. From braids to wigs, we wear them to protect our natural hair and also to try different styles without damaging our natural hair. On Monday I an silky straight 20inches hair and on Tuesday a big afro. Hair is a way to express ourselves. I'm sorry black women having fun with their hair makes you sad.
all songs by haley kiyoko and she's really good, robyn is also a good artist, and 'I kissed a girl and i like it' is probably the most well known one. christine and the queens is pansexual and did a duet with charlie xcx who is part of gay culture (don't know their sexuality) teagan and sara are also gay but i don't know how good their music is, sia is bi (i think) and although none of her songs are directly about being gay, her music is really good

It appears you are some sort of Arab, therefore there may have been some cultural miscomprehension in our exchange. Nevertheless, I still regard your original point as defective in its assessement of the reality of the situation.
Honestly? It just doesn't feel like I'm allowed to feel anything about it as it's a crime to be gay where I live so I try not to think about.  I wish I could go out to a club, dance to a Donna summer song and snag a guy to celebrate this month but no, that's not an option. If you have the opportunity to celebrate it, please do so for yourself and for everyone who can't, this includes a 30 year old chub that can't because of where he is.

If society ever broke down, you'd be searching for masculinity to save you. Pathetic.

Sincere question. What is Parsi community's views on BJP and Modi overall. Also for Fadnavis. The recent issue about temple and metro has made a headlines and made me believe Parsis have strongly become anti-BJP. But when the issue was resolved by metro guys making extra, post-SC order changes to metro line, hardly any media covered it. Is there any changes in the views after it. I had some Parsi friends in my childhood so I'm eager to know about it.

Because I doubt one genuine look at history would leave anyone wondering if "being white" in the U.S. will be perceived as a problem.

Damn. That really put something words well that I've been thinking of for awhile. How I feel like most of the Christians I know only care about me being a Christian, not about who I really am and how I really feel.  Whereas now that I'm Pagan, I have friends who are spiritual, agnostic, atheist, and even a few open-minded Christians who actually accept me for who I am and care about me being myself more than about me following their personal beliefs. It's like it's showed me who really cares about me as a person.

I think it's very important for LGBT people who have grown up in homophobic environments, especially young people, to see a bunch of people like them being joyous and visible for a month, just to show them that the future can be a happy place for them too. Imagine being made to feel lesser and ashamed your whole life and then seeing a whole parade dedicated to celebrating and defending people like you! It can be a literal life-saver.

I don't think anyone should be supported just because of their race but I do think we should motivate more Asian Americans to run for political positions. That said, he's a good look for Asian Americans. He's well spoken and is liked by the younger generation. Whether or not he gets president I think he is representing us positively and will have plenty of other chances to run for political positions.

Yes of course women sport particularly, there's some trans super women breaking records lately.
It's actually because men need to be funny to hook up with women. We train to be funny, whereas a lot of women comedians think people should laugh just because they are on stage and the audience should be supportive. If you aren't funny, we aren't going to laugh. I've heard great female comedians, but it's not hard to see why there are more male comedians. Girls don't need to be funny to have sex.
I have no gripes, but I grew up envious of the looks of my full filipino half brother ( i just think asian guys look cool) so I would be happy if I was full asian. However, I dont like the idea of being or looking like someone other than myself so im content. Im pretty asian passing as well so that's adds to it. Culturally, im basically just asian so being a hapa is a negative in that light since I never get treated as such by anyone outside my asian friends.
Wait, there aren't minority groups that are privileged over other minority groups? If it's based on demographic saturation, larger minorities *can* be racist towards smaller minorities. A black person has a legacy of racism to contend with, but they don't have to worry about the "illegal immigrant" or non-native speaker prejudices experienced by Hispanic people in the United States. Is that not privilege? If a black person can call ICE on a legal Mexican immigrant and who could then potentially be detained for hours or days, when the reverse would not occur, is that not power?

how very sad that Gail's mother felt the need to pretend she was white .... which of course stems from black people being made to feel very second class citizens by white people - which they're not. It must have been a constant burden for her. The irony, I think, is that for me anyway, people of mixed race parents are amongst the most beautiful people on earth.
this was a huge thing i struggled with when i was still a guy but im glad its out in the open that bisexuality doesnt only mean you like girls, guys and gamers equally

IDK, you do have some valid points but as far as I'm concerned, pride is essentially for the sexuality/gender minority- folk who are not straight. I kinda think aces should be a part of it- maybe they aren't as discriminated against, and maybe it isn't such an unusuality as the other sexualities or whatever, but still! That's just my opinion though, and I'd say I'm fairly biased anyways.

Kenyan samosa's didnt come through the middle east.. they were brought to Kenya from India.

When Kenya gained its independence Indians fled to either India or Britain (where my father went). The cuisine that india brought to Kenya remained as part of the local culture.
in this fandom we should accept everyone for who they are, no matter what skin colour, nationality, gender, sexual orientation, kind of music you like, what you wear, how you look, IT DOESNT MATTER. all that matters is that your a nice person to others, if you aren't then goodbye
Similar to my grandparents lesbian friends on Long Island in the sixties... one was a NYC judge and the other a bit of a bohemian. They often watched my mom and her siblings and were favorites in the neighborhood, but no one ever addressed their sexuality, just called them spinster friends.  Sad that gay couples couldn't be more open, but good that they weren't ostracized and could be active community members in some places.  It's heartening to know my grandparents loved them so much and gave me some solace as a teen before coming out to them.

If someone declares they believe in Jesus, then they are not a Jew - he does not believe in our faith. It's simple. Both in Israel and across the Jewish world, there is a blanket rejection of Messianic Jews. They are ineligible to make aliya, because it is not accepted that a Jew can believe in Jesus. Therefore they are excluded from the Law of Return as people who have voluntarily converted out of Judaism. The Supreme Court ruled the Messianic Jews belief in Jesus makes them Christians, thus ineligible for citizenship. - Jerusalem Post 12/16/2017
YES! Thank you for mentioning it. It means very much to a lot of us.  I'm thinking this is especially important in a lot of countries where LGBTI people still face lots of discrimination and where probably most LGBTI trainers are in the closet.

Men are still ten times more likely to die on the job. As we get more "equality", I don't see women taking dangerous jobs from men. Women are taking safe jobs from men so even more men will die on the job. If we were to have a another Vietnam (60,000 killed), 97% will be men. Men die earlier than women, but spending on woman's healthcare research (breast, ovarian cancer etc.) is four (4) times greater than the sending on mens healthcare research (prostate, testicular cancer etc.). The list goes on.

It's good that you are proud to be mixed race people. In fact, despite the increase in recent posts, I still feel a majority of us are proud of our mixed hertiages. Don't let another person's negativity affect your sense of identity, cuz even tho you might relate to them in some ways, it is still their identity issues. It's still from their own accord and how adaptable they are as people, not you.

It's just really pointless and insulting to people who actually experience racism by implying our society is in need of a reminder that being a white person is okay. Because I doubt one genuine look at history would leave anyone wondering if "being white" in the U.S. will be perceived as a problem.  The very concept of on a personal level being okay with the fact you were born with the skin color you were born with is of course not racist. But the statement just makes it seem like white people are at risk to become some sort of outcasts.

Yeah this is the answer I was expecting. But surely the best way to normalise it is to bring all populations together. If straight people feel excluded, an 'us vs them' mentality grows. When really, being LGBTQA should be just as normal as being straight. Perhaps a summer festivity anyone can partake in and be celebrated for would help good feelings blossom, even between those who might be narrow-minded or have outdated views.

It refers to a series of societal benefits (or lack of certain problems) of being male compared to being female. Obviously things aren't unilateral, and there are certain issues a man might face that a woman wouldn't, but in general there are quite a few benefits to moving through the world as a man compared to as a woman.

Artam Ghotbi Immigrants are not bad for the economy, no, but it is said that in the schools it becomes difficult when there is a language barrier. There is need to have programs and special language classes for those in need, so some people think that it hinders the education of others. I read an article on this topic. In some way I understand the hesitancy, but everyone wants a better life for their children and move where they think it's better.
That makes sense tbh, I do already feel somewhat more connected and decent in myself just by letting the truth out. My mum was the same... she said she'd rather id just come out as gay in the first place aha my dad too but yeah wasn't quite that simple.

As a short butch I personally have no issues re: height but can see where they might come from. Butches kind of want to be masc and powerful and being tall/having more mass is seen as going along with that, so they can develop the same insecurities short men seem to get sometimes..... that's their problem, though, not yours! Tall women are wonderful so don't give up till you find someone who acknowledges that!!
You're an amazing man, inside and out. So grateful to have met or at least chatted with a guy as cool as you. Too many men are insecure about their sexuality and are offended when they get a compliment from another man. It's nice that you know who you are and what you like. Thanks for being a friend.

Does my life from 18 to 32 count as a moment? Seriously though, the earliest moment for me was seeing a queer show in college at 18. Drag queens, kings, trans men and women, non-binary and varying types of queer; doing stage performances, lip syncing, etc. This was the first time I saw a trans woman in person, and all I could think was "I wish I could be her."
Why is that bad though? I really didn't care much about being South American until I was older because I thought it made me less US-American.  I've only learned to love the fact that I'm South American as I got older and embraced by accent, the fact that I can speak Spanish, and the fact that the only passport I own is Argentine.  I got older and I got wiser. What's wrong with that?
I love that you enjoy being trans.
My older son's been out since childhood and one of his favorite stories is about his paternal grandfather coming to his high school awards ceremony to see him get an award for LGBTQ work.

Yeah i live in a swing state(PA) but where i am everyone is very accepting. Nothing i love more than going down to the gayborhood in philly. And my bf is a very progressive, liberal person so he definitely likes to learn a lot about me and my sexuality too(hes also a straight cis male) and thank you so much! Plan to rock it often
I'm in Florida I'd love to shove my fist in your slutty little pussy then fuck it till your full of my cum baby

My parents(white folk) lived next to a family from Pakistan, who always brought them food when they had celebrations, holidays, or as a thank you for something. I could never remember the names of all the different types of food, but it was all clearly home made and delicious! We learned so much from them, and the food was a perfect icebreaker for getting to know them better. They were wonderful people. Hard to find neighbors like that, (white folk) included.
Also, I am happy they are in both Canada and America because without them, the refugees would have no food or shelter.

I'm happy that you're happy. All too often there's so much drama and in-fighting, as if dealing with the outside homophobic and heteronormative world wasn't enough. It personally took me a while to be happy, and I had a lot of growing up to do. I was really fortunate that I had good gay peeps in my life that were willing to listen and be there and I hope every young gayby gets the same opportunities. Enjoy Pride Month, man. It's gonna be a blast! :)
I got a funny story about the first and last time I fucc a girl in the ass lol
She says she'd rather me be a happy woman, rather than a miserable man, or dead, it'll just be hard for her. We're also both Christians, and come from conservative backgrounds, so it's like a double culture shock. On top of that, her brother just came out as gay (thanks to me coming out as trans I guess) and she's having a rough time of it. She kind of saw him coming out, and wasn't surprised, but I'm a shock.
Duh! They should have stayed and fixed their own country.  ^^^/s

My boyfriend used to work in Hollywood Studios. While waiting in line for ToT a cast member stopped us and talked to my boyfriend for a little bit... Then she told us that we didn't have to wait in line and gave us fastpasses ( the wait was ~120 minutes). I really wanted to give her a hug.  Not really an "experience" but there's a trans bellhop and whenever I see her it makes me smile and appreciate the fact that Disney is 100% fine with trans people, and that the world in general is more accepting of LGBT+ individuals. Apparently she's a really nice person too.

Maybe I'm just American an far removed from India at this point even though my parents are from there but cant we all just get along.

I didn't so much discovered that I was bi as I discovered that not everyone was, lol. I grew up with LGBT family members, so I never had any concept that it was something to be worried about being. It took me a long time to realize that some people genuinely could not feel that way about specific genders. It confused me until I was in like 5th grade
I've certainly had times where I thought. You know if I were straight it'd probably be easier. But then I remember that thanks to my being queer I have found my home and my family.  I am what I am. I am my own special creation.

>To me its better than being atheist though.....if I was not catholic I guess I would at the very least be agnostic or spiritual To be clear, atheism wasn't a choice I made. I didn't wake up one day and say "nah, I don't feel like being Catholic anymore." It was just something I became convinced of as I grew older.  I guess my point is that on the most fundamental level, people become Catholic because they are convinced it is true. Likewise, people leave the Catholic Faith when they are no longer convinced it is true. The same is true with any faith or non-faith.
male /māl/ adjective 1. of or denoting the sex that produces small, typically motile gametes, especially spermatozoa, with which a female may be fertilized or inseminated to produce offspring. If the individual cannot produce male gametes and was not born with the ability to create male gametes; then they are therefore not male.

The Bhagavad Gita (one of the Hindu sacred texts) SPECIFICALLY says that we are the soul, not the body. The soul has no race, gender or material designation and therefore anyone can benefit from spirituality and culture. THAT is Hinduism.

I think all transgender people don't want to be "trans", they want to be just "male"/"man" or "female"/"woman".  Hard part is that with changes, we directly change sexual interactions. Partner may expect something from sexual relationships, so that's main reason it's not good to fully be closed (at least with those with whom you considering serious relationships). So, yes. I will never be "true" woman. Never will experience menstruation, pregnancy. It's hurt. I wish people just accept me with my gender like any other person with traditional gender - don't bother, don't "see" it, see just me.

But... how is it any different than giving your child a gendered name?  That's why I don't really get the hate for gender reveal parties. It's just people having fun, and I know parents who do it who are also super supportive of trans people (myself and my friends). And something like 99% of people will give their kids gendered names which essentially do the same thing: reveal the genitals of their children. But we're not all up in arms about that.

It takes belief in false morality to commit atrocities. Those who believe in the false morality of anti-abortion, anti-gay religions are primed for authoritarianism. They use their beliefs to prop themselves up as superior to others. They excuse all transgressions made by hose who share their beliefs. That is how they excuse the obvious and undeniable immorality of Trump. It is only a small step from there to dehumanizing others and committing genocidal acts like separating migrant children from their parents or ignoring the threat of climate change.

Makes sense but not all South Asians come here on F1/H1B either. 80% of my family came here on family based immigration. Most of them struggled for years, saved up money and bought businesses back in 70s/80s and prospered. My parents came here on family based immigration and had to work minimum wage jobs for 2 years before they could apply for residency here and work as doctors.I see it happen even today.
Great relief to millions of women. Government's efforts to uphold the rights n dignity of women finally overcame d Opposition's hurdles. URL

So long as we are consistent and keep Bond and Ariel white. Whites should not have to give up their representation simply because they have more than POC.
I am curious as to how having a lot of 1st gen Indians will help you. ABCDs grow up in a different culture than people like us (immigrants from India) and I have often found that ABCDs have their own circle of friends and don't like to interact much with immigrants.

It's actually because men need to be funny to hook up with women. We train to be funny, whereas a lot of women comedians think people should laugh just because they are on stage and the audience should be supportive. If you aren't funny, we aren't going to laugh. I've heard great female comedians, but it's not hard to see why there are more male comedians. Girls don't need to be funny to have sex.
In this time of generation...all you see is people with straight hair and (I'm an afro-Latina) I used to think that straight hair was the right thing so I would always straighten it but I relized...I'm not white...I'm not Ecuadorian...etc...I'm a half black half Puerto Rican girl and I came to love myself and my hair(none of my cousins have curly hair....I'm the only one with curly hair in my family)

It's just really pointless and insulting to people who actually experience racism by implying our society is in need of a reminder that being a white person is okay.

The very concept of on a personal level being okay with the fact you were born with the skin color you were born with is of course not racist. But the statement just makes it seem like white people are at risk to become some sort of outcasts.

I don't know if it's normal for toddlers, but I react similarly to (usually) mosquito bites. Some people just have super adverse reactions. Discomfort aside, the bites are not overly harmful, but keep and eye on them. I once had a bite become infected (presumably from the scratching) Use a marker to draw a ring around the original bite and contact your Dr immediately if it expands and/or you get a white ring around the bite.
I'm in favor of the Dream act too dude - many people are.

I'm all for immigration reform - I'm even all for allowing more immigrants in, but this all begins by accepting that we must enforce our borders.

Agreed. I grew up catholic and did my first communion, confirmation and went to church every Sunday. Eventually when I became older and less dependent, I stopped caring what they thought. My mom is suuuuper catholic. But I just told her one day that I dont believe in that stuff anymore because it's a choice now, not required of me. She still doesnt like it, but it happens. Still tries to change my mind, but not gonna happen. You got this OP!!!!

@ElectionLawCtr @JYPETWICE Fun facts about Japan: Immigrants are less than 2% of the population. Accepted twenty (20) refugees in 2017. Crime rate is four times less than U.S. Outperforms U.S. on literacy, longevity, voter turnout and numerous other social indicators. But, hey, "diversity is our strength"

Im a white older male...and I honestly don't think its her ethnicity that is the problem as much as her being out of touch. My kids have some pretty different opinions on current events and their perspective comes from and entirely diffent place based on their age and being in the here and now. I do agree with the rest of your statement
That argument for diversity was true last century but we have much more diversity now (case in point: God Friended Me). SJ is just stunningly beautiful as well as talented, and most important to producers, attracts more people to see her movies. When Morgan Freeman can play God, you've arrived. To get ahead, it helps to be the best, if a transgender person wants that role, maybe start by producing film shorts showcasing their talent?
We indeed have to struggle with racism. The general unemployment rate where I live is around 10% while the unemployment rate of middle eastern immigrants there is around 30% despite most of them being very qualified educated and qualified professionals. You do what you have to do to provide for yourself and your family, it's indeed an ingenious decision (I believe that there is indeed a number of people doing that) and you get the fun observing people's reaction to your name.

He's always been very accepting of other people's way of life, and I've always been proud of that.

It's just really pointless and insulting to people who actually experience racism by implying our society is in need of a reminder that being a white person is okay. Because I doubt one genuine look at history would leave anyone wondering if "being white" in the U.S. will be perceived as a problem.  The very concept of on a personal level being okay with the fact you were born with the skin color you were born with is of course not racist. But the statement just makes it seem like white people are at risk to become some sort of outcasts.

Look, I understand and empathize with your position. But there have been people working with the trans community for decades on this issue. Working to help them to the best of their ability, to help them lead happy and healthy lives. And the current way things are done is the result of those years of efforts. The medical community that has sprung up around this topic are *on it*. We are not at the stage of treating trans people where wild ideas that people just thought up out of the blue, we're at the "its been decades and we have a good idea oh how to help."
Eh, I don't really care much. Bahasa Indonesia serves its purpose nicely: to be a unifying language. Nothing more, nothing less.

Both are crimes. Influx in crime doesn't mean you ignore it. It takes time to build structures, and until then more criminals means cramped space.

When it comes to denominations I am usually reminded of 1 Corinthians 3. We as believers are called to be united as one body. I believe we all need each other (Baptist's, catholics, Pentecostal, etc) to encourage each other, sharpen one another, and bear each other's burdens. There are aspects of the Catholic Church that I wish Pentecostals would pick up and vice versa. I don't think it matters what denomination you choose, the only thing that does matter is that Jesus is your Lord, that you seek to glorify His name, and that you show His love to others.

It takes belief in false morality to commit atrocities. Those who believe in the false morality of anti-abortion, anti-gay religions are primed for authoritarianism. They use their beliefs to prop themselves up as superior to others. They excuse all transgressions made by hose who share their beliefs. That is how they excuse the obvious and undeniable immorality of Trump. It is only a small step from there to dehumanizing others and committing genocidal acts like separating migrant children from their parents or ignoring the threat of climate change.

I'm going to pitch in with something I haven't seen anyone else say. I agree with how you view privilege and all that. I'm not sure if you are white or not, but I'm assuming you aren't. It's not that you're wrong about privilege. It's just really really hard for people who have had a hard life to be told it could be worse and that they're lucky they're white. No one who is at rock bottom or who has been there before likes to have their experiences trivialized. That's why a lot of talk about "white privilege" falls on deaf white ears.

You presume a lot about my beliefs. If he highlighted some people are forced to wear it I would not cry Islamophobia, but good attempt at a strawman. You also provide no reason why it shouldn't be normalised. I don't care so long as people choose to wear it and it would be an invasion of personal liberty to prevent that. If it is wrong for people to socially pressure women to wear a burqa or niqab, it is wrong to pressure them to wear other things. It doesn't harm others, so what reason is there for banning it at all?
Geez. What a mess. I get we need to manage ALL borders. I dont understand how ppl get mad and protest when they are here illegally. It's a fucked up mess. Trump is a douche bag.

Your first step in all of this is to talk with a therapist (and with a transgender support group, if possible) , which has absolutely no negative consequences. Get on those as soon as you can. The difficulties and joys transitioning will add to your life are real and legitimate, it's up to you to *honestly* weight the situation and discover what is the best decision for you and your family. You have no obligation to make a decision either way beyond the obligation to live your life as best as you possibly can.
It is pretty great being White.
Heard an analogy from a friend. "You can cut down trees your entire life but not be a lumberjack. But you suck one dick and you're gay"
They always ALWAYS manage to frame it as "rigged in favor of women. And ugly guys left to rot."  ALWAYS forgetting guys have personalities, charm, power or prestige, love, morality, contagious inspiration etc...  "ugly guys" with any of these succeed but magically "disappear" when it's time for the incel to claim that their only flaw is looks and they ACED all other social characteristics.

Hi, the local NPR station here did a series of stories on being Black in Seattle. You might check it out: ​ [URL-in-seattle](URL-in-seattle)
It's actually because men need to be funny to hook up with women. We train to be funny, whereas a lot of women comedians think people should laugh just because they are on stage and the audience should be supportive. If you aren't funny, we aren't going to laugh. I've heard great female comedians, but it's not hard to see why there are more male comedians. Girls don't need to be funny to have sex.

It's just really pointless and insulting to people who actually experience racism by implying our society is in need of a reminder that being a white person is okay. Because I doubt one genuine look at history would leave anyone wondering if "being white" in the U.S. will be perceived as a problem.  The very concept of on a personal level being okay with the fact you were born with the skin color you were born with is of course not racist. But the statement just makes it seem like white people are at risk to become some sort of outcasts.
@Timcast I wonder if Iran, Russia and China are like, Hey should we try to invade The U.S. now and they think about it and say no they're going to destroy themselves soon enough without us needing to lift a finger.

Look, I've been writing female characters for a decade and a half and suddenly everybody is all "there are never any good female characters" and the people shouting the loudest are writing the crappiest female characters there are. It's horribly insulting to men who have enjoyed writing, reading, and watching female character, and horribly insulting to the women these horrible female characters are supposed to appease.  I'm tired of it. If someone thinks they could do better, then they should create their own stuff instead of insulting everyone.

It refers to a series of societal benefits (or lack of certain problems) of being male compared to being female. Obviously things aren't unilateral, and there are certain issues a man might face that a woman wouldn't, but in general there are quite a few benefits to moving through the world as a man compared to as a woman.

Men are still ten times more likely to die on the job. As we get more "equality", I don't see women taking dangerous jobs from men. Women are taking safe jobs from men so even more men will die on the job. If we were to have a another Vietnam (60,000 killed), 97% will be men. Men die earlier than women, but spending on woman's healthcare research (breast, ovarian cancer etc.) is four (4) times greater than the sending on mens healthcare research (prostate, testicular cancer etc.). The list goes on.

To be honest this raises a good point about how little americans care for social justice outside of African-Americans. Native Americans are the most disadvantaged people in this country in so many ways but get only a fraction of the attention that African-Americans get. I'm not saying African-Americans should get less attention but we really need to take a step back and talk about Native American in a new context and on a new timeline.

> Where do we disagree on the term logos? The Torah / Word defines God's logos. it's less a sense of "torah" instruction, and more a platonic form of rationality. > How do you interpret John 1:1? that john thinks jesus was the incarnation of philo's coming messiah, who would be the logos. > Many twist Paul.  i don't think i am. paul clearly thinks jews are still held to the law, but that christians do not have to convert judaism. christians are outside the law by merit of ancestry.

Same here. I feel honestly guilty that because I didn't fully accept my sexuality until years after I'd been with my boyfriend and we've been together so long my rural, religious family just assumes I'm straight so I've never had to come out to them. It's easy to say it's because they're in another state but I haven't even told my coworkers/friends because some are guys and I feel like they'll see me as a novelty like "oh it would be hot to see you make out with a woman" like that's all it is for us.
I'm a guy and I say this is bullshit. I'm a complex dude. I have lots of emotions. Men are only simple because they've been trained to be that way and surpressed their true selves.

I loved this movie. Octavia Spencer's acting was superb. It really spoke to the unique alienation of a Black woman in the world in general but especially in predominately Caucasian settings - being belittled at work, being forced into a maternal role regardless of the circumstances, not being seen as a viable romantic partner, being isolated from social groups while Black men are able to "fit in" by conforming to stereotypes of coolness, athleticism, and sexual prowess, and being forced to rear children alone. Very unique perspective for a horror movie.

I'll let you be your true self, even if nobody else does. I know this won't help a lot, but it's true. I hope you find happiness and peace, and if I can help with that, let me know.

1. It wouldn't surprise me, as some sects uphold different rituals than others. That isn't my experience, but I haven't done enough research on that topic to answer it completely.  2. I can only speak for myself, but being raised Christian, I fully respect other religions. My personal beliefs are that there are multiple routes to the same destination. As for the wider community, I saw a lot of tolerance, but I also saw a lot of intolerance. I think overall, Jews just keep their opinions to themselves, especially the From Birthers.

I'm not jewish and do not condone being Jewish but man this is fucking awesome bro,
Current partner of four years is an atheist, and we bonded over our shared experiences with leaving religion. I LOVE being with someone who totally understands my perspective. Even if I was single, I could never date a religious person again. Respect to those who make it work! But don't feel that you have to hide it. The right person will get it.
The factors leading people to move can be complex. Often the causes are multi-faceted. Migrants may move across international borders to improve their lives by finding work, or in some cases for education, family reunion, or other reasons. People may also move to alleviate significant hardships that arise from natural disasters, famine, or extreme poverty. Those who leave their countries for these reasons would not usually be considered refugees under international law.

It's just really pointless and insulting to people who actually experience racism by implying our society is in need of a reminder that being a white person is okay. Because I doubt one genuine look at history would leave anyone wondering if "being white" in the U.S. will be perceived as a problem.  The very concept of on a personal level being okay with the fact you were born with the skin color you were born with is of course not racist. But the statement just makes it seem like white people are at risk to become some sort of outcasts.

I Thought the enslavement of the natives didn't start until after the plagues hit the americas? The europeans were initinally looking for trade-connections and then found a continent with people. When they returned again the populations of the continent had been brought back to almost nothing incentivizing the Europeans to do everything they shouldn't have done but did.  ​ Besides, weren't it the mongols that brought it to europe? it was a side-effect of their conquest.  ​ I don't know why you think that what the europeans did was something so different than what the mongols did.

Just did a world trip and I would say that South America + Turkey in general were super excited about seeing Asians. KPOP is big in South America and I had a girl in Turkey scream and run to me excitedly asking me if I was Korean/Japanese. Didn't face any discrimination, and people in Latin America & Turkey were friendly as hell. But in general, if you're asian-looking, they will assume you are from Asia. Had one guy in Turkey said I don't look like I'm from America. If anything, they may ask some ignorant-ish questions but nothing malicious.

Men are still ten times more likely to die on the job. As we get more "equality", I don't see women taking dangerous jobs from men. Women are taking safe jobs from men so even more men will die on the job. If we were to have a another Vietnam (60,000 killed), 97% will be men. Men die earlier than women, but spending on woman's healthcare research (breast, ovarian cancer etc.) is four (4) times greater than the sending on mens healthcare research (prostate, testicular cancer etc.).

It's just really pointless and insulting to people who actually experience racism by implying our society is in need of a reminder that being a white person is okay. Because I doubt one genuine look at history would leave anyone wondering if "being white" in the U.S. will be perceived as a problem.  The very concept of on a personal level being okay with the fact you were born with the skin color you were born with is of course not racist. But the statement just makes it seem like white people are at risk to become some sort of outcasts.

Similar to my grandparents lesbian friends on Long Island in the sixties... one was a NYC judge and the other a bit of a bohemian. They often watched my mom and her siblings and were favorites in the neighborhood, but no one ever addressed their sexuality, just called them spinster friends.  Sad that gay couples couldn't be more open, but good that they weren't ostracized and could be active community members in some places.  It's heartening to know my grandparents loved them so much and gave me some solace as a teen before coming out to them.

It's just really pointless and insulting to people who actually experience racism by implying our society is in need of a reminder that being a white person is okay. Because I doubt one genuine look at history would leave anyone wondering if "being white" in the U.S. will be perceived as a problem.  The very concept of on a personal level being okay with the fact you were born with the skin color you were born with is of course not racist. But the statement just makes it seem like white people are at risk to become some sort of outcasts.

I used to think the exact same way as you. I had basically accepted that I'd probably live a life devoid of any romantic love when I started my transition.

I'm currently in a relationship with an absolutely wonderful cis lesbian. Dont give up hope girl, I'm confident that there's a wonderful lady out there for you!

I didn't come out until I was 28 and by that time I had been married to a woman for over 4 years, she wasn't impressed but for me it was and the single greatest thing I had done for myself. I got my own place and have really enjoyed the journey my life has taken since then and I am at the very start of a new relationship with a guy that is completely different from my other past relationships and I am really looking forward to where that might take us.
This was literally me. I thought I was ace even though I was crushing on two different boys at the time... though I guess I'm glad because thinking that I was ace is what first got me questioning and got me involved in the queer community.

It takes belief in false morality to commit atrocities. Those who believe in the false morality of anti-abortion, anti-gay religions are primed for authoritarianism. They use their beliefs to prop themselves up as superior to others. They excuse all transgressions made by hose who share their beliefs. That is how they excuse the obvious and undeniable immorality of Trump. It is only a small step from there to dehumanizing others and committing genocidal acts like separating migrant children from their parents or ignoring the threat of climate change.

It's actually because men need to be funny to hook up with women. We train to be funny, whereas a lot of women comedians think people should laugh just because they are on stage and the audience should be supportive. If you aren't funny, we aren't going to laugh. I've heard great female comedians, but it's not hard to see why there are more male comedians. Girls don't need to be funny to have sex.
Thank our failed immigration policy and worthless politicians for creating this mess--agriculture needs these workers in order to work the fields and feed Americans, yet we as Americans are imprisoning and scaring away the hands that farm our fruit. All of these people should be working in America which is what they want and what we need in this country. If we had a better immigration policy these people would be here legally.
Ah passing as in "passing as". My brain went straight to "passing by" and I was wondering why to celebrate a relationship that's almost over. *facepalm*. Thanks a lot! And I kind of relate to how you feel. I'm not 100 percent sure what kind of queer I am. I know that I'm not straight and that's important to me, but I feel like I can't come out properly because I haven't quite figured out my label yet. I, too, am a bit afraid people will think I'm just drawing attention to myself, when I can't say if I'm Bi or a Lesbian. Thanks for explaining and sharing!

"Coming out" is becoming less and less of a thing with each passing year, which is great. No one should have to be worry about repercussions -- be it family, friends, work -- because of who they love. The only profession where it still seems to be somewhat taboo is male professional sports. And even those walls are slowly coming down.

How does me being trans, me wanting to be a girl even though I was born a boy, have anything to do with you? Let me live my life how I want, you're living your life how you want to, right? Everyone has the right to aspire to be the person they want to, right?

Go back to the old practice of prohibiting meat consumption during Lent and Advent. Encourage Catholics to study engineering and work on renewable, nuclear, and thermonuclear power systems. Encourage urban living (less gasoline-burning in cities than in suburbs).
Coming out is something very intimate. It means sharing a very personal fact about yourself with people. Only you should decide who gets to know you like that. If you think someone doesn't deserve to have this kind of information or you fear what they might do with it then you have no obligation to tell them. However you might be missing out on a very profound and supportive friendship and I think that friends and allies are crucial to a happy life as a gay person.  In the end the choice is yours to make. I hope I could help. You'll find your way. We all will.

Best (straight) friend in high school said I was the most beautiful man he had ever known, no homo. Never thought much of myself, but it still makes me happy.
NAH. You let people become parents. You are only the biological father. You are literally just any other male except you share some DNA
I wasn't intentionally trying to misinterpret you, I just thought it would be problematic if any group of people found it offensive to celebrate the LGBT members of their group. I personally don't see anything wrong with having Mohammad, Jesus, or any religious figure in rainbow garb. More power to them.

Two of my friends have 4 parents, all gay. It was surprising at first but they're all great people. They're on good terms with the kids so my friends just have more adult guidance in their lives. It was interesting to piece together when they talked about their families.
Hey man, im only one year older than you. I actually had a kind of similar experience except when i found out she wanted to transition i kind of lost all attraction for her/him. If you still want to persue her/him then thats completely okay, it would mean your not straight but not necessarily gay. Before asking them out you need to find out if she/he likes guys, so become friends first. maybe message her/him and say congrats on coming out and that you're happy for her/him
Trans rights are human rights
Girl, I'm the same  almost doubly so because I'm trans. Stereotypes upon stereotypes are heaped upon me that I'm expected to conform to. You're exactly right, you need to be comfortable with yourself more than anything else. Get plastic surgery if you want (I know I am), but do it because *you* want it not because *they* want it.
Lady in the back Blinks when "her" camera red light goes on. Part of the tranny SHOW. Before ya deny...see: Transvestigations on Yt. Trannies are PROUD to show How It's Done!
I don't honestly feel able to answer because I don't get a choice, but transition has given me a flat chest and a dick and facial hair and honestly I'm happy. Dysphoria has been difficult at times but I have been "lucky" enough to receive affirming healthcare, and I'm comfortable with being trans. I would lose so much of my experiences if I were cis that I can't say I would choose to be like that, I'd be such a different person and I like myself as I am.
As a former Cis guy, I have to agree. Hugs, Daisy

It's just really pointless and insulting to people who actually experience racism by implying our society is in need of a reminder that being a white person is okay. Because I doubt one genuine look at history would leave anyone wondering if "being white" in the U.S. will be perceived as a problem.  The very concept of on a personal level being okay with the fact you were born with the skin color you were born with is of course not racist. But the statement just makes it seem like white people are at risk to become some sort of outcasts.

I'm not trying to justify my way of church service, so much. Rather, I would like to understand some of my brothers and sisters who prefer a different service. I am not trying to "convert" them, but do want to get into their shoes. For me, the danger seems to be that these churches are almost always related to bad/poor teaching as well. It is easy to condemn the whole thing, but I am trying not to.

Yes, in barbaric, authoritarian cultures that have since been condemned. Interesting that Christians desire to perpetuate the same idea.
It's actually because men need to be funny to hook up with women. We train to be funny, whereas a lot of women comedians think people should laugh just because they are on stage and the audience should be supportive. If you aren't funny, we aren't going to laugh. I've heard great female comedians, but it's not hard to see why there are more male comedians. Girls don't need to be funny to have sex.

It takes belief in false morality to commit atrocities. Those who believe in the false morality of anti-abortion, anti-gay religions are primed for authoritarianism. They use their beliefs to prop themselves up as superior to others. They excuse all transgressions made by hose who share their beliefs. That is how they excuse the obvious and undeniable immorality of Trump. It is only a small step from there to dehumanizing others and committing genocidal acts like separating migrant children from their parents or ignoring the threat of climate change.

Lovely picture i just wanna know that how people see interracial marriage in these years. I am Asian btw so I don't know anything about racism or history. Just curious about this, I wanna feel the atmosphere throughout your story.
My two closest friends. I knew they'd be accepting and one of them was openly bi as well. I'm still not out to anyone else yet. I know they'll be accepting but I just haven't felt the need to tell them. And funny story, it turns out the other friend is bi or at least somewhere towards the middle of the Kinsey scale. So I guess LGBT magnetism is a real thing?

I would wager it's really just anti-sex if you really get down to it. They don't want anyone having fun in bed. Making abortion illegal will result in marginally less extra-marital fucking, maybe, especially if they can get rid of some birth control options too. Sure, maybe some women will have headless rape-babies, but it's a small price for someone else to pay in service of your own sense of superiority.

@mattzollerseitz This reminds me of a person I met who told me to research how Michelle Obama had a sex change. I obliged him, intrigued to see how fake it was. It was a blogspot that said "Satire" on top.  He told me the article would open my eyes on what we need to pray for in our country.
NTA. I'm being raised currently in a Hindu family and honestly it's really interwoven with our culture, just like many other religions. You can be atheist and still like and participate in certain aspects of your ex-religion because it's still part of your culture and a part of you. And who is she, a Christian, to speak on whether or not you can get a Hindu tattoo when it's your culture and name.

My wife is bi. We had another couple we did this with. Basically my wife and the other couple had a threesome then a week later it was me my wife and the women from the couple. Everyone enjoyed themselves a lot but we talk a lot about boundries and other things leading up to it. It did help that my wife and the other women are both bi tho
The part that finally got to me was this: >while you don't dislike your current gender, you still experience euphoria from dressing like/being called a different gender. That's basically exactly how I feel right now. I am fine being male, having a penis and everything (but I hate having body hair), yet at the same time, when I imagine being treated like a girl, or dressing up like one, I have that tingly feeling, that sense that while I'm satisfied now, I'd be happier like that.

Men are still ten times more likely to die on the job. As we get more "equality", I don't see women taking dangerous jobs from men. Women are taking safe jobs from men so even more men will die on the job. If we were to have a another Vietnam (60,000 killed), 97% will be men. Men die earlier than women, but spending on woman's healthcare research (breast, ovarian cancer etc.) is four (4) times greater than the sending on mens healthcare research (prostate, testicular cancer etc.). The list goes on.

Did you just ask why they need help and then list the primary reason? The fact that they are discriminated against and not treated fairly is why they need our help. We need to treat them exactly how we treat everyone else. We need to step up and help bigots understand their point of view is wrong and we don't support discrimination. We need to help by making them feel welcome and free to do and feel as they want. So yes they need help and this is how we help.

Same. Currently hoping that my current makeup of being Bi, gender-blind and open to just about anything and everything wins out.
I definitely agree with this, I am a Bi girl who has a for sure preference for girls. However, it's very hard for me to find other queer girls that I'm interested in, but I have found myself being hit on by guys frequently which would give me the option to date them (If I wanted to.)
I'm not out either, but none of my family and friends really care. When they ask or mention the subject of having a boyfriend I just shrug it off. Sometimes say "why would I need a relationship? I'm not interested in that stuff" and nobody really cares. One of my friends once told me in a discussion about sexuality (cause another friend is gay, and she might be bi) that I'm probably aromanic and asexual. That's the closest to being out that I am. Your avatar looks really nice btw \^\^
It's really nice that it's a lot more acceptable for people to come out these days.

This is based off of the original Chinese story of Mulan, but there is a huge mistake made in this. Mulan was from Northern China and fought to protect the northern border, but in this film, her family is seen living in a Tulou, owned by the Hakka (which are from the south). The people from China saw this as disrespectful and ignorant towards Chinese culture, claiming that the movie was made to appeal western audiences.

Acceptance of others decisions to be who they are.  I know that it is not the same at all schools, but the kids now seem to be way less phased about race or LGBTQIA than in the past. I'm not saying there aren't issues, but it doesn't seem to be much of a thing. Most of the information around this that goes out is more geared towards making the parents comfortable.  They also seem to be less religious, and if they are, a general spiritual belief rather than organized religious; more accepting of others beliefs, or lack thereof.

genuinely like as a trans person it becomes difficult to differentiate regular bodily insecurities and dysphoria sometimes so i'll realize i'm insecure about something that was previously "unimportant" compared to my dysphoria/was heightened by hrt and i'll be like OH GOD WAS IT
It's just really pointless and insulting to people who actually experience racism by implying our society is in need of a reminder that being a white person is okay. Because I doubt one genuine look at history would leave anyone wondering if "being white" in the U.S. will be perceived as a problem.  The very concept of on a personal level being okay with the fact you were born with the skin color you were born with is of course not racist. But the statement just makes it seem like white people are at risk to become some sort of outcasts.

Race is a good indicator of culture and beliefs. It doesn't mean you have to do anything, but it definitely creates statistically significant trends. Just the same way religion, education, and career does.
Come out. Not living your truth has got to be so draining. If your family doesn't accept it at some point then it's their loss. There's nothing wrong with being gay. One of my best friends is First generation Korean and his family had a lot of trouble with it at first. After a couple years they came around. I think it basically came down to his dad missing him and telling the wife she had better figure out how to get over it.

Ngl /r/egg_irl has been a huge help to me because all the trans people I know IRL are at the stage where they're very confident about it and sure of themselves and my floundering questioning ass was struggling to justify calling myself trans without being like that.
I don't even know why, dude. The country I'm from has a very low height average, so I'm taller than a lot of guys and I'm taller than most girls, I've never met a girl from my country who's taller than me (5'10), I think the tallest woman I met was a 5'8 classmate of mine. I realized I was insecure about my height when I went on a vacation to the USA and even though I was taller than most women, on rare occasions, I came across a few women who were an inch or two above me.

It's actually because men need to be funny to hook up with women. We train to be funny, whereas a lot of women comedians think people should laugh just because they are on stage and the audience should be supportive. If you aren't funny, we aren't going to laugh. I've heard great female comedians, but it's not hard to see why there are more male comedians. Girls don't need to be funny to have sex.

absolutely - realizing that there was this _whole other world_ that the women in my life experienced, and I not only didn't see it, I didn't even know it was there... once I really listened to the people talking to me, it wasn't that hard to value listening to people telling you their experience instead of telling them what their experience is (I would've happily argued with a person of color over whether racism was real), and that there was oppression at play around me in far more complicated ways than any of the stats about pay gap I was citing even touched.
agreed, there is no american feminism or middle east feminism. there's a "white feminism" term that refers to "feminists" that only care about problems of wealthy white women (manspreading, mansplaining, etc.) and there's actual feminism that cares about the important stuff like struggles of women in middle east. you don't have to be american to be a "white feminist", you can be american and still be an actual feminist.

I completely understand this. I like both women and men but I never dated a woman and ended up married to a wonderful man. I don't know to the extent I like women (would I have dated one if I hadn't met my husband at 21, etc) but it was a very confusing time for me. Thankfully my husband has been understanding and encouraging me that it's okay to be who I am (and honestly we check out women together like goofballs).  I guess all that rambling to say, I'm here if you want to talk about any of this and I'll be completely understanding. Feel free to reach out anytime
It's fine to be upset. Rejection and sexual frustration are upsetting, and you should be allowed to vent your frustrations in a constructive, supportive environment.  It is NOT fine to advocate, threaten, or condone rape. If you think women deserve to be raped because you haven't found someone willing to let you flail pathetically around on them for 43 seconds, then I think you deserve to cry alone, rotting in your semen encrusted underwear alone, until you die. Alone.

"White" is such a weird category. It's not a real thing. There isn't a white culture (what would that be? bagpipes from Ireland and pierogi from Poland? Is that the same culture?) and the distinction between white and non-white is not genetically meaningful either. There is no "white" nor "brown" nor "black" nor any other clean category like that where you can neatly fit people into. So stop being offended over some imaginary category you don't fit into because it doesn't exist.

I don't believe the line of questioning about your move to cut your daughter's hair is rooted in malice. Possibly, if I may, as an African American woman for so long we thought our identity was rooted in our hair, for example the "Good Hair" complex. It stems from our horrible past as slaves, through Jim Crow and present day racism. No we are not our hair but we are always judged from head to toe.. Also, it was hard to watch Robin 2nd guess her decision to cut her hair. But I hope she maintains the level of confidence and pride you were cheering her on with in the video.
ah, ahem, policing what women call themself. that's a yikes

My wife did RCIA and I was her sponsor. I was a bit disappointed in the RCIA program in terms of how it barely touched the surface of Catholicism. Meanwhile, most of the candidates were really thirsty to get into more depth. I think it was a huge missed opportunity. So I would like to let you know to plan on pursuing your curiosity and search for truth without relying on RCIA to bring this to you. Finally, welcome to the Catholic Church. It's a rich, seemingly complex thing that you are embracing.
I love that you enjoy being trans.

Ok I don't know why but this image is legit making me emotional. I'm in my car trying to hold back tears.  It's just seeing a gay black man own who they are and rallying a crowd to celebrate themselves along with him. Ugh God it's so beautiful.
Men are still ten times more likely to die on the job. As we get more "equality", I don't see women taking dangerous jobs from men. Women are taking safe jobs from men so even more men will die on the job. If we were to have a another Vietnam (60,000 killed), 97% will be men. Men die earlier than women, but spending on woman's healthcare research (breast, ovarian cancer etc.) is four (4) times greater than the sending on mens healthcare research (prostate, testicular cancer etc.). The list goes on.

Beautiful video. Glad to see the A added to LGBTQ+ and making LGBTQA+. I am Asexual (hereto romantic)  Was an ally before I found out. I have been afraid to come out, but when I learned what my situation was called and that there are more people like me I was trilled. I can still fall in love with men and still get married. So happy, thank you for the video, it gave me courage. Hello to all the Try Guys.

You guys are seriously spreading the conspiracy theory that the muzlamics are taking over? You do realise that the racist white person who created this image probably views all brown skinned people as Muslim? These people think all non white people are invaders trying to take over Europe. You're just spreading their conspiracy. Shame.
I know you are being sarcastic but I do. On this sub I actively support many causes including many unpopular ones. From animal rights, gender inequity, racism, heightism/weightism, etc. I am not from the LGBT community. This is just one of the issues I support. I voice out strong opinions or cold hard facts that people find it hard to accept emotionally or are too short sighted to see. I call upon the Catholic community to do what is right here and denounce conversion therapy. I will even go so far as to say they must change their belief that homosexual acts are sinful.

Well, BITD, in jolly ol', it was sometimes mortally illegal to be Catholic, and sometimes mortally illegal to be Protestant, and always mortally necessary to be one or the other. Depending, it seems, on who married whom, or wanted to. GTFO, right? So, a lot of people did. And brought their religions with them. And the right of religion being the first of the rights guaranteed in the US constitution convinced a LOT of people that religion was the shit. Happily, a Beneficent Deity invested us all with True Understanding, so we get along fine now.
Why is that? What idea is this that you cannot admire other human beings not sexually? Not everything is sex. I can admire a guy's beauty, yet, not feeling sexual attracted. Does being straight make me fucking blind? Can you not distinguish between a nice looking and a bad looking man? If I say "my mother has cute blue eyes" does that mean I'd love to shove my dick in her?
I was originally southern baptist (because bible belt) but I eventually left due to spiritual abuse. I identified as agnostic for awhile until I found this subreddit!

Aro/ace people are 100% welcome and included in the Pride rainbow! Be out and proud!  I know in my city there has been a lot of shit by a few loud queer folks putting down others who don't present outwardly queer (bi, pan, ace, trans, non binary, and on) . I'm pan and poly but am currently in a straight passing relationship and have gotten shit for this by certain queer folks. But move past any haters who don't recognize that being part of a pride event is more than just presenting queer. You're part too!
I just get frustrated with this thread, seeing that the only correct answer is at the bottom while a bunch of incorrect ones gets upvoted. Sexuality isn't something you change, if you have bi-tendencies you've always had them but porn might have made you discover them. Sexuality is a spectrum, you can still be mostly straight with a preference for the opposite gender, but have a small in comparison preference for the same gender. Sexuality isn't something anyone should be ashamed, it isn't something you can force change on, and spreading those misconceptions about it is dangerous

I think any guy whether they are average or below average looking can get a girl to fall in love with them or even just hookup with them. I see it all the time. Beautiful Women dating men who are unattractive. I use to think these women were maybe after money. I think with some people looks just doesn't matter to them. Take for instance Jay-z and Beyonce. Everyone thinks she too pretty to be with him. He actually dated a lot of beautiful women even though people find him unattractive.
Hey man, im only one year older than you. I actually had a kind of similar experience except when i found out she wanted to transition i kind of lost all attraction for her/him. If you still want to persue her/him then thats completely okay, it would mean your not straight but not necessarily gay. Before asking them out you need to find out if she/he likes guys, so become friends first. maybe message her/him and say congrats on coming out and that you're happy for her/him
That is so true!! It happens in Latin America though. The concept of ethnicity and nationality are combined or in better terms there is more emphasis on nationality. However, you do you! There is a different culture in the US so there is no point in conforming to what another group of individuals say about how you should feel and see yourself.
People do that far too often. When people say "If the Jews had guns, they could resist!" WE DID. The Warsaw Ghetto Uprising, the Partisans, Jewish troops in the Allies. We fought back, but ragtag rebels normally can't resist empires.  The worst is when other Jews do it.

No, it's being attracted to both sexes. It's in the name. Just like heterosexuality/homosexuality is being attracted to the opposite/same sex (or anyone who looks close enough to the opposite/same sex in that person's eyes). Gender plays no part in sexual attraction - it's *sex*ual. I can't stand this pandering shit. Just abolish sexualities altogether, how can nobody see that the idea itself is what's harmful to the trans community and not the definitions? Stop convoluting things to hell and back.

No, the chances of a muslim shooting you in America is almost nil. There are over 50K gun deaths every year christian USA. We should be focusing our attention on Christians and less on peace loving Muslims.
It's just really pointless and insulting to people who actually experience racism by implying our society is in need of a reminder that being a white person is okay. Because I doubt one genuine look at history would leave anyone wondering if "being white" in the U.S. will be perceived as a problem.  The very concept of on a personal level being okay with the fact you were born with the skin color you were born with is of course not racist. But the statement just makes it seem like white people are at risk to become some sort of outcasts.
I'm grateful to attend a nondenominational church where I live. However I haven't and cant come out to the public just yet; I've only told a handful of friends I consider very close.  And thankfully, the friends that do know fully support me; their concerns are to keep my heart and walk in Christ.

It's just really pointless and insulting to people who actually experience racism by implying our society is in need of a reminder that being a white person is okay. Because I doubt one genuine look at history would leave anyone wondering if "being white" in the U.S. will be perceived as a problem.  The very concept of on a personal level being okay with the fact you were born with the skin color you were born with is of course not racist. But the statement just makes it seem like white people are at risk to become some sort of outcasts.

Men are still ten times more likely to die on the job. As we get more "equality", I don't see women taking dangerous jobs from men. Women are taking safe jobs from men so even more men will die on the job. If we were to have a another Vietnam (60,000 killed), 97% will be men. Men die earlier than women, but spending on woman's healthcare research (breast, ovarian cancer etc.) is four (4) times greater than the sending on mens healthcare research (prostate, testicular cancer etc.). The list goes on.

Especially on hot days I don't envy men who have to wear suit on formal occasions while I am allowed to wear a short dress.

The labeling of Italians and Irish as white when they were widely considered undesirables came about because of labor disputes during the labor rights movement. It was a concession given to the Irish and Italians in order to divide the revolting working-class based on race and slow the labor movement.

Penises are kinda neat and sex physically feels good. The social/interpersonal aspect is a whole other matter, however. They're nice to look at sometimes. Often, actually.  When they do something cute, and it's weirdly endearing, and it makes me happy inside. I suppose this one is specific to moids I'm crushing on/attractive to but guys being cute is really really nice  I like that compared to vast majority of men, depending on the day, how I feel about myself/am dressed etc I feel kind of feminine next to them.
LEVITICUS 19:34 The alien that resides with you shall be to you as the citizen among you: you shall love the alien as yourself, for you were aliens in the land of Egypt: I am the Lord your God.  Pretty clear what God thinks of immigration. He didn't cage, arrest, or deny the needy. It's funny how conservatives choose mans law over gods law when it suits them politically. God is watching conservatives and he is VERY disappointed. For ye are the wolves in sheep's clothing.

It takes belief in false morality to commit atrocities. Those who believe in the false morality of anti-abortion, anti-gay religions are primed for authoritarianism. They use their beliefs to prop themselves up as superior to others. They excuse all transgressions made by hose who share their beliefs. That is how they excuse the obvious and undeniable immorality of Trump. It is only a small step from there to dehumanizing others and committing genocidal acts like separating migrant children from their parents or ignoring the threat of climate change.

>For Asian American, it's pretty evenly split in preferences.  ​ Asian American women tend to prefer or seek a specific type of Asian American guy. The Asian American women I know all tend to want this type of guy, who they describe as a hot Asian guy. But because they're more rare and highly in demand (by women in general), they're hard to get. It's the equivalent of how African American women describe specific African American men that fit the mold they want as "one of the good ones" - the phrase being used in African American films and mags.

It's actually because men need to be funny to hook up with women. We train to be funny, whereas a lot of women comedians think people should laugh just because they are on stage and the audience should be supportive. If you aren't funny, we aren't going to laugh. I've heard great female comedians, but it's not hard to see why there are more male comedians. Girls don't need to be funny to have sex.
So yes, white people, you chimp.
Same here. I had no one know about me. Even saying I was Bi was barely a thing. Surprised a lot of people but I'm really no different. I get to express myself as a gay man now and that's most important. A trusted, sexy partner and the confidence to know I'm doing the right things to set an example for my kids.

I first learned the term bisexual because of him when I was a kid back in 2003. I grew up in a super Pentecostal Christian home where LGBT did not exist, so Billie Joe being out since 1995 and letting kids like me know bi people existed was pretty life-changing. I hope I can thank him in person one day.
I know straight couples who do it.  I'm in one. For me sex has always been casual and fun, not really tied to love or romance. We're in our 20s and look good, we still are attracted to other guys, and we like to go out and pick up boys either together or apart (sometimes our tastes diverge). We keep not excessive, and at the end of the day, we live together and come home to each other (with stories, usually). It's fine, not for everyone, and also not for every relationship. I probably wouldn't do this in any other relationship, but it works here.

My father is still a follower, but it makes me wonder how much stronger his relationship with Christ could have been if he didn't have so many false teaching angrily forced upon him.

Men are still ten times more likely to die on the job. As we get more "equality", I don't see women taking dangerous jobs from men. Women are taking safe jobs from men so even more men will die on the job. If we were to have a another Vietnam (60,000 killed), 97% will be men. Men die earlier than women, but spending on woman's healthcare research (breast, ovarian cancer etc.) is four (4) times greater than the sending on mens healthcare research (prostate, testicular cancer etc.). The list goes on.

@CarrieGiunta @mxmovement Brilliant clip. The way the media portrayed the riots back then couldn't be further from the truth. It was all about young people looting and stealing sneakers, when the context was police oppression, lack of opportunities and hopelessness among young black working class people.
The only two women on this list that are legit are Oprah and Queen Elizabeth II (but Oprah more so due to her literally pulling herself up by her own bootstraps). Also, apparently people really admire women who marry well as evidenced by Michelle Obama, Hilary Clinton, and Melania Trump being on this list.

To me the key was starting from the Christian side of the anxiety. You say you don't believe it's a sin anymore, but emotionally you're still conflicted. Just keep looking for suppotive, affirming people and resources to help you change your mindset from "LGBTQ is *not bad*" to actually celebrating those people and relationships.

Agreed. Obama and Hillary views changed as well just like her. There was few candidates in 1990s who were pro gay marriage. This is a topic that has evolved over time. We shouldn't condemn people for putting their egos aside and being willing to change their views when they realize they were in the wrong like tulsi has. She is now very supportive of lgbt.

Yes, it is possible to have a transgender identity & feel no need to transition medically, socially, or legally. It's a personal choice. Not wrong. I'll admit most trans people feel at least a need to do at least something to feel better.

This post breaks my heart man, I have a gay brother that came out in high school and I do not want to imagine him living a life that isn't him.  You just gotta do you, you only get one shot at life and happiness and you deserve both.  Good luck, I hope it all clicks for you.
From a young age, as I was exploring my sexuality, I came to find myself fantasizing about both men and women. Looking back to when I was even younger, I realized I idolized men and women both even then.  Now I identify as pan since I feel like it better describes my preferences, but you could consider me bi (I often say I'm bi out of convenience).
Yep! I've got a whole post about my struggles with it actually... Unfortunately, mine went the opposite way of yours, and mostly towards men, and as a straight trans woman, that means mostly cis men, which is just... not great...

White people insist there is no racism or that it's impact on people like me is minimal. If this is the case, why do so many biracial or mixed race people pass as white? If their life would be so easy being mixed race, why try and pass yourself off as white? People do this as they know they will avoid experiencing racism.

It's actually because men need to be funny to hook up with women.

I've heard great female comedians, but it's not hard to see why there are more male comedians. Girls don't need to be funny to have sex.

Man, I'm Latino and had married a Pakistani. I think that's a much wider cultural divide, but we were able to bridge it. It just takes mutual understanding, respect, and (in some cases) standing up to your family.  If your mother doesn't want to get along with this woman because she's Bengali, your mother is making a conscious choice. You have to love and respect your mother, but she's totally wrong with the idea that your cultures are incompatible or something. Bengalis are also delightful.

Men are still ten times more likely to die on the job. As we get more "equality", I don't see women taking dangerous jobs from men. Women are taking safe jobs from men so even more men will die on the job. If we were to have a another Vietnam (60,000 killed), 97% will be men. Men die earlier than women, but spending on woman's healthcare research (breast, ovarian cancer etc.) is four (4) times greater than the sending on mens healthcare research (prostate, testicular cancer etc.). The list goes on.

The legitimacy of the church isn't as important as the legitimacy of the rite. Baptism, in the name of the Triune God is the issue. Similarly, most folks might not balk at a Church of Christ baptism, even though they're fully Pelagian. I think if one is truly concerned, they should speak to their elders/pastor about it and seek rebaptism, but so long as they understand what baptism is/isn't.
I dont think its muslims in general, but for sure muslims in this region. Caveman ways, caveman mentality. Horrendous violation of women's rights, torture innocent children for entertainment. Nothing good has ever come out of this region, and nothing ever will.

I'm Mexican, so if course my little sister had a 15 (quince) like many of us do.
dudes need to grow up and get over themselves. Maybe it's because I'm trans (or a decent human being), but I was livid when my partner told me her ex's made her hide them in a drawer rather have them within reach of the toilet. I'll never have a period, but that doesn't change the fact that half the human population deals with it; it's bad enough as is without all the cultural shame and stigma.
@savedwolf83 @Skot777 @Seamusss2 @AiG Who highly acclaims he Bible per chance? I guarantee it isn't any scholar secular nor religious. Facts are facts and we can show the Bible isn't factual in the main stories it represents.
It's just really pointless and insulting to people who actually experience racism by implying our society is in need of a reminder that being a white person is okay. Because I doubt one genuine look at history would leave anyone wondering if "being white" in the U.S. will be perceived as a problem.  The very concept of on a personal level being okay with the fact you were born with the skin color you were born with is of course not racist. But the statement just makes it seem like white people are at risk to become some sort of outcasts.

I've felt the same way in my mid teens, but it was due to being in a very religious rural area in Alabama.

I'm no historian, but if my factual sources are correct there were still major discrimination, with a famous example being the instanbul pogroms, which basically resulted in almost all of the ethnic Greeks moving from the region. IIRC correctly there are maybe just a couple of thousands left in a country with millions of inhabitants. (Not that this is of course if my sources are factually correct)
Ok I was over simplifying, not intending to bad mouth, just pointing out my experience so far is if you mention that your beliefs or lack thereof don't align with religious people then there seems to be very little chance for any kind of discussion. I can't say I have thought about it from the point of view of believing the person you love will suffer, but repeating prayers won't change what you believe regardless of how much he or anyone else hopes

It takes belief in false morality to commit atrocities. Those who believe in the false morality of anti-abortion, anti-gay religions are primed for authoritarianism. They use their beliefs to prop themselves up as superior to others. They excuse all transgressions made by hose who share their beliefs. That is how they excuse the obvious and undeniable immorality of Trump. It is only a small step from there to dehumanizing others and committing genocidal acts like separating migrant children from their parents or ignoring the threat of climate change.

Oh, totally. Both videos are incredible. Natalie's videos are amazing a general.

At the best of times, some of the stories I hear make me admire these people all the more. The difficulty of moving halfway across the world, oftentimes to a place with barely any other Chinese people, having to learn a new language and customs and be away from your extended family... it's all hard to fathom. While I've met plenty that have barely integrated (a woman in Guyana, holding a Guyanese passport, unable to speak anything but Chinese and needing my help talking to authorities), the majority that do, they make me aspire to be even more adaptable in life.

Totally understand your uncle and appreciate your post. It's something I accepted a long time ago and really there is no need for anyone to recognize it in a celebratory way. My family has known for years but at every family celebration or gathering my cousin has to bring it up like its a badge of honor or something.

It actually embarrasses her more than us because she's trying too hard to be inclusive or something. "Bless her heart." lol

I've always been partial to the Oriental Orthodox Church, myself. I've found their arguments regarding Chalcedon to be more convincing.  In any case, do you consider yourself a universalist? In other words, are you ok with Islamic societies doing the same thing but with Islam, since they view it as objectively true? Or would you prefer they accept Catholicism?  I do appreciate you answering these questions. I very much disagree with you but I like to read people's arguments and see their line of reasoning.

Just did a world trip and I would say that South America + Turkey in general were super excited about seeing Asians. KPOP is big in South America and I had a girl in Turkey scream and run to me excitedly asking me if I was Korean/Japanese. Didn't face any discrimination, and people in Latin America & Turkey were friendly as hell. But in general, if you're asian-looking, they will assume you are from Asia. Had one guy in Turkey said I don't look like I'm from America. If anything, they may ask some ignorant-ish questions but nothing malicious.

His advice isn't exclusively for males. It resonates the most with males and I don't see that as a bad thing unlike many of his detractors. He basically wants people to be the best version of themselves and take personal responsibility.  I disagree that feminism is identify politics. It depends on the feminist and their particular brand of feminism. If group identify is more important than the individual then they are engaging in identity politics.

It's just really pointless and insulting to people who actually experience racism by implying our society is in need of a reminder that being a white person is okay. Because I doubt one genuine look at history would leave anyone wondering if "being white" in the U.S. will be perceived as a problem.  The very concept of on a personal level being okay with the fact you were born with the skin color you were born with is of course not racist. But the statement just makes it seem like white people are at risk to become some sort of outcasts.

You don't have to relate to her for it to be rep, like I'm Asian and I don't really relate to her but knowing that person who looks like me is a superhero is pretty cool, and thats all that representation is, to show people that they can be whatever they wanna be, and that your ethnicity doesn't matter.
I relate with almost every single thing you said (minus the fact that I'm not feminine). But I wouldn't change my sexuality even if it was possible, I like guys, I like the fact that I like guys and, even if it's difficult and knowing that I'll probably be alone for the rest of my life, it took me a long time to realize it about me and I'm happy knowing who I'm.
It's not necessarily required, but it helps. Whether Muslims or Christians acknowledge or not, they too, look to a form to help with their worship. Christians have the cross, the catholic Christians have the saints, mother Mary etc. Muslims have the Kaaba.
Agreed. Obama and Hillary views changed as well just like her. There was few candidates in 1990s who were pro gay marriage. This is a topic that has evolved over time.

"White" is such a weird category. It's not a real thing. There isn't a white culture (what would that be? bagpipes from Ireland and pierogi from Poland? Is that the same culture?) and the distinction between white and non-white is not genetically meaningful either. There is no "white" nor "brown" nor "black" nor any other clean category like that where you can neatly fit people into. So stop being offended over some imaginary category you don't fit into because it doesn't exist.

but what about things still happening right now , like police shooting and mass incarceration of black people you know segregation ended just 62 years ago. senator kamala hariss was part of second class to be desegregated so if she had been born just two years earlier she legally would not have been allowed to attend the same school as white children, isnt that treating some one like the are second class citizens ??

It's just really pointless and insulting to people who actually experience racism by implying our society is in need of a reminder that being a white person is okay. Because I doubt one genuine look at history would leave anyone wondering if "being white" in the U.S. will be perceived as a problem.  The very concept of on a personal level being okay with the fact you were born with the skin color you were born with is of course not racist. But the statement just makes it seem like white people are at risk to become some sort of outcasts.

My grandma is Italian (her parents came through Ellis Island in the 1910s), and even if that's only 25% of my DNA, I still like to tell people that I'm Italian because she was the only one of my grandparents who took the time to teach me about my heritage. Like, yeah, I'm an American, and that's important to me, but the Italian culture my grandma passed down to me is also important. If I met someone actually from Italy, I wouldn't say "I'm Italian too!" because I'm not really, but I might still tell them that that's where some of my family is from.

My life has improved dramatically since I first came out when I was 15. Being able to take control of my life and transition both socially and physically has been amazing. What most people don't know is that when you are trans you don't just come out once. There's coming out to your family, your friends, at school, at work. It never actually ends. Every new person you meet is someone that you might come out to. You also have to decide if you want to come out to someone. You don't have to. It might be unsafe to. It might work out wonderfully and you'll gain a new ally.

It's actually because men need to be funny to hook up with women. We train to be funny, whereas a lot of women comedians think people should laugh just because they are on stage and the audience should be supportive. If you aren't funny, we aren't going to laugh. I've heard great female comedians, but it's not hard to see why there are more male comedians. Girls don't need to be funny to have sex.
Maybe I'm just American an far removed from India at this point even though my parents are from there but cant we all just get along. Modi has done some great things for the country and almost every Indian prime minister has been known for creating some human right violations.

It's a recent phenomenon in the West to consider adopting another culture's ways as a cause of offence.

I could see a cause for offence if the original poster did not indicate the origin of the Gods in question, but s/he has given due credit to Indian civilisation and religion.

It takes belief in false morality to commit atrocities. Those who believe in the false morality of anti-abortion, anti-gay religions are primed for authoritarianism. They use their beliefs to prop themselves up as superior to others. They excuse all transgressions made by hose who share their beliefs. That is how they excuse the obvious and undeniable immorality of Trump. It is only a small step from there to dehumanizing others and committing genocidal acts like separating migrant children from their parents or ignoring the threat of climate change.

Not trying to argue or what but Catholicism is a christian denomination BY definition. They're a follower of Christ (whether a "follower of christ" has a different definition depending on your faith/belief), therefore they're christians. Being friends with Born Again Christians, it seems like the term "Christian" has also became synonymous to them, at least in the Philippines. I'm curious though, why/how it has became onto. And btw if you're wondering OP, I'm an atheist so you can expect a "somehow" objective perspective from me.

It was extremely formal how she approached it with me. Birds and bees and I was embarrassed and wanting to die, but to her credit she was always supportive of both my siblings and my sexuality and letting us know where the condoms were at and to not get a girl preggers. She always said that it doesn't matter if we're gay or trans or whatever as long as we're happy. So far so good on the happy part.

But there is a difference between showing the respect and faith, i have nothing against Buddhists, but i dont pray to their God.
Agreed, my family dont like that fact I left Christianity and were devistated and upset, they love me heaps and I think its similar to how they disagree with me and think my lack of faith is a bad thing. I couldnt have a more accepting Christian family, I think if its done properly its totally fine.

He convinced a lot of nazis to leave their regional group... By being realistic with them. By being the "one good" black guy they new. And in knowing him it made them empathetic with the people they were harassing etc. It changed the situation from an "us vs them" to a realistic vision of greys. Respect and tolerance will get us further than shunning with these types of people.

It's just really pointless and insulting to people who actually experience racism by implying our society is in need of a reminder that being a white person is okay. Because I doubt one genuine look at history would leave anyone wondering if "being white" in the U.S. will be perceived as a problem.  The very concept of on a personal level being okay with the fact you were born with the skin color you were born with is of course not racist. But the statement just makes it seem like white people are at risk to become some sort of outcasts.

Kabbalah Zohar comes from people who rejected Jesus as the Messiah.
My parents(white folk) lived next to a family from Pakistan, who always brought them food when they had celebrations, holidays, or as a thank you for something. I could never remember the names of all the different types of food, but it was all clearly home made and delicious! We learned so much from them, and the food was a perfect icebreaker for getting to know them better. They were wonderful people. Hard to find neighbors like that, (white folk) included.

>To me its better than being atheist though.....if I was not catholic I guess I would at the very least be agnostic or spiritual To be clear, atheism wasn't a choice I made. I didn't wake up one day and say "nah, I don't feel like being Catholic anymore." It was just something I became convinced of as I grew older.  I guess my point is that on the most fundamental level, people become Catholic because they are convinced it is true. Likewise, people leave the Catholic Faith when they are no longer convinced it is true. The same is true with any faith or non-faith.

It's actually because men need to be funny to hook up with women. We train to be funny, whereas a lot of women comedians think people should laugh just because they are on stage and the audience should be supportive. If you aren't funny, we aren't going to laugh. I've heard great female comedians, but it's not hard to see why there are more male comedians. Girls don't need to be funny to have sex.

I was gonna say this lol. But it seems to be regional-dependent from what I can tell (in regards to the States, I mean). Like, I'm from the South and an open-relationship is still a very rare thing to come across.    But over the West coast, they'rs downright proud of how they've "redefined the meaning of relationship", gay men especially. (I took a trip to San Fran last October and I can't tell you how many times I heard that "we've redefined it" line dropped in bars as soon as a guy realized I was southern haha.)

As a jew , that's a dumb question . IMO all religions are kinda the same. They all are just some old books. The traditions and holidays that create a culture is pretty beautiful. All religions says "Don't kill or steal , just be good" . Saying there is a screwed up part is... A judgement that you cant really make. Differences that came from other cultures , that you are probably not qualify to judge.

Perhaps not quite so strident as that. Maybe if we asked if Salafist and other hard-line islamist types were returned, there might be a more congenial response.
Maybe they're trying to be a uniting force for muslims of the country as a community rather than an ideology, most tunisians identify as muslim but are non-religious, maybe that majority demographic is who they are trying to appeal to

Never understood why someone feels the need to proud of their race at all. You did nothing to earn it, you can't change it, it doesn't (shouldn't) matter to anyone and if it does that's their problem not yours. If a person wants to look back through history and take pride in their ancestors accomplishments well, OK, but that's not a personal achievement. You could as well claim to be proud of your gender, or your height, and that would all seem pretty meaningless. If we define ourselves by our colour, then others will too. Not a good thing in general, if history is any lesson.

As a Christian I agree it has nothing to do with being good . Faith has nothing to do with being good or bad..
It actually definitely is. Have a look at the Australian Census for how many people claim to be Christian 52% (Catholic another 21%), and then try to apply that percentage to church attendance in your churches. If the Census accurately reflected the amount of Christians, and most of those Christians went to church, then they'd be lined around the block at every church.

It was easy to hide that side of myself when there was no one else involved but that's changed, and I'm not one to hide my relationships away from anyone.
Historic racism may have an influence but I also thing autosegregation has more of an influence. Without making diversity a priority people tend to spend time with groups that are similar to them. The church's we do see that are very diverse are often churches with white leaders that make it a priority. Many black churches don't make diversity a priority.
Nice story. And you're right about the unifying thing. Believing in God, country, duty and the golden rule is under threat. I was born to an Iowan army officer in Berlin just before the wall went up. My wife was born a year later in Okinawa to a Filipino naval officer. Met in San Diego at 24. Married a year later. Do filipina women count as Asian by this Indian? Oh, I now have an adult successful mixed race son and 10 nieces and nephews all mixed Asian and white. They are all beautiful and I couldn't be more proud of them. I just don't get the hate.

Yeah, if your therapist recommended it, I would absolutely try it out. If it's too awkward, maybe find a different one. The LGBTQ center closest to me has a number of groups tailored to specific age groups and stages of transition. My anxiety around it is if I go, then it makes this all real. But all I want right now is a safe space where someone will call me by my chosen name, so I guess it already is.

Exactly. That's why it's considered 'removing privilege'. If white privilege is ever successfully dismantled, white people such as myself will no longer have privilege as a result of an arbitrary skin pigment differentiation. I think that's a good thing overall, so this isn't how I frame it, but I do see why many people can feel threatened by the idea of losing privilege, especially when they may be systemically oppressed based on other categories (economic class, physical capability, mental health, height, gender, sexual orientation)

But haven't women and colored actors acted in remakes which were originally made cult movies around white actors or men. Granted, a lot of them were horrific (ghostbusters), but the point is that Hollywood has done its fair share and I don't think an actor should have to punished because of a sense of pseudo-moralizing disguised by moral outrage.

If we all weren't raised to believe feminine=bad I think more men would feel comfortable exploring where they might land on the spectrum too. I think now more than ever men who would otherwise consider themselves "straight" are seeking other men for shmoozles and I think that's great. Heteroflexibility is wonderful. Destigmatizing actions, items and behaviours we've as a society deemed "feminine" can go a long way to helping women and men. It's what feminism is all about. Good for men and women.

Men are still ten times more likely to die on the job. As we get more "equality", I don't see women taking dangerous jobs from men. Women are taking safe jobs from men so even more men will die on the job. If we were to have a another Vietnam (60,000 killed), 97% will be men. Men die earlier than women, but spending on woman's healthcare research (breast, ovarian cancer etc.) is four (4) times greater than the sending on mens healthcare research (prostate, testicular cancer etc.). The list goes on.

Trump left it as her choice. The crowd's speech "required" it -- and let's remember "The Squad" are the authoritarians here. People oppose her because she stands against Liberty and the core tenets of Western Society. It would have been wise for Trump to stop the chant and point this out so he would have had the image of holding the high[er] moral ground.

It's quite sad to hear actually. I'm a guy, and I'm here specifically to talk to girls because the vast majority of my friends are male so I don't really know how to talk to a woman. I don't want to be branded a weirdo for it because some freak wants to mail dildos to people, but at the same time I completely sympathise with the women who believe that because it's probably far more common on here than I realise.
Mackenzie Davis is super cute. She was great in Halt and Catch Fire, and did well in the other roles I've seen her in.

Chicks who basically get fame and money simply through their attractiveness. They are streamers or YouTubers who literally have no appeal other than the fact they are hot. Might as well go the whole hog, no?
Dude seriously people like her are the most banal, bored, and terrified on the inside. Nothing arouses this girl's genuine passion, she has no interests in anything beyond what her body tells her to crave and seek out. You aren't missing out on anything by not being with her. Practice skills you love, master them, and wait for girls who interest you to show interest in you. Seriously. There are few creatures more dangerous to be involved with emotionally than a young, bored girl raised in affluence. Everything is a toy to them.

I mean, I was operating under the assumption you knew nothing about your background. My mom is half Japanese and I'm closest to her Japanese mother, so even if my dad weren't Japanese, I still would have roots with Japan. So I get where you're coming from. Just do what feels right to you. It's not like you're suddenly claiming to be Native American or something.

It's a big mistake to conflate community with a subset of the population based on a single shared characteristic. There's certainly no gay community, and it seems suggestive that being gay I should be given the final word on it. Somehow.

Finding a group of queer friends who included me and validated me was huge. My girlfriend validating me as "not just an ally" was also really helpful. I actually found my queer friend group through a support group for trans people and their families/friends.

Do nuns still take vows of poverty these days? I know they are evil Catholics but that always blew my mind how the nuns had to do that but priests didn't. I think all pastors and religious figures should have to take vows of poverty.
I also wish transfolk all the best and hope they find peace.  I do think there are some concerning elements, like this yaniv chick, and people shouldn't be afraid to criticize her or to ask questions about some of what's going on in the trans community.

I relate with almost every single thing you said (minus the fact that I'm not feminine). But I wouldn't change my sexuality even if it was possible, I like guys, I like the fact that I like guys and, even if it's difficult and knowing that I'll probably be alone for the rest of my life, it took me a long time to realize it about me and I'm happy knowing who I'm.
Well, I realized that if I do come out and tell everyone I'm gay, I'm still the same dude that my friends and family know and love. Me being gay doesn't change any of that. I still like what I like, and still have the same interest but now I'm sharing that I also like other guys instead of women. Oh and here meet my boyfriend. That's how I accepted myself

Men are still ten times more likely to die on the job. As we get more "equality", I don't see women taking dangerous jobs from men. Women are taking safe jobs from men so even more men will die on the job. If we were to have a another Vietnam (60,000 killed), 97% will be men. Men die earlier than women, but spending on woman's healthcare research (breast, ovarian cancer etc.) is four (4) times greater than the sending on mens healthcare research (prostate, testicular cancer etc.). The list goes on.

I get this discussion when it comes to disabled and people of color. These actors cant change that and have less oportunities for roles. But gays and trans roles can be played by evryone. And on the other side, beeing gay or trans does not exclude you from straight roles. So SJ Platin ganz asien Robot is a other story than SJ playing a trans person.

@RosaliaGaming God loves him as a person but that doesn't mean he loves his actions. When you do something wrong, your parents still love you. I used to be "independent" and "free thinking" but only with Christ did I finally see clearer. There is a way of harmony and a way of chaos. Pick one.
Its a bit of both. I beleive in G-d because ive been brought up that way, but i feel like i have my own connection to Him. The Torah can be proof but I dont really need it. It's not there to proove (or prove) us right, its to teach us how to live. Thats why we dont have missionaries go out to get people to join us. When people try to convert, we push them away to make sure theyre serious.

I have listened deeply to Ravi back when I was christian.  I would also like to say that I have overcome many emotional and personal barriers within my life, many dealing with how people treat the lgbtq+ community. We each have our own journey filled with obstacles, and I'm still going. I do, however, believe that breaking free of the church and finding out myself was part of those obstacles. I can finally live how I was born without hating myself.

It takes belief in false morality to commit atrocities. Those who believe in the false morality of anti-abortion, anti-gay religions are primed for authoritarianism. They use their beliefs to prop themselves up as superior to others. They excuse all transgressions made by hose who share their beliefs. That is how they excuse the obvious and undeniable immorality of Trump. It is only a small step from there to dehumanizing others and committing genocidal acts like separating migrant children from their parents or ignoring the threat of climate change.

So I'm bi but I feel this subreddit is still somewhat relevant to me, but heres my thoughts.  I myself wear band tees and other stuff that isnt the usual LGBT associated attire, sometimes I do but not often. But I've hardly ever had issues out at gay bars or with my gay friends.   Some have asked why but most people dont really care I think. But you'll always have haters no matter how you dress. Just do you and dress how you want, not for others approval

It's just really pointless and insulting to people who actually experience racism by implying our society is in need of a reminder that being a white person is okay. Because I doubt one genuine look at history would leave anyone wondering if "being white" in the U.S. will be perceived as a problem.  The very concept of on a personal level being okay with the fact you were born with the skin color you were born with is of course not racist. But the statement just makes it seem like white people are at risk to become some sort of outcasts.
One of my African American patients pulled me aside and told me how proud he is to see people of color in my position. Although this seems like such a simple comment, it meant the world to me. I need to keep working harder so more people of color can be in my position.

They have not craved attention. Fox news, Trump, and any right wing media outlet use them as bait for people like you. They know if they insult women, especially dark skinned women, the racists eat it up.
[This](URL-us-canada-48521788) was on the news yesterday. Not 30 years ago, one day ago. It is still important for LGBT to stand up and say 'Hey, we're people too and we deserve to be treated like it.' Unfortunately, there's still progress to be made.

Two of my friends have 4 parents, all gay. It was surprising at first but they're all great people. They're on good terms with the kids so my friends just have more adult guidance in their lives. It was interesting to piece together when they talked about their families.
True, true. I consider myself non-denominational but I have, of course, seen and been to mazaars (shrines) of both shi'a and sunni sufis. I think I was referring more to the sort of... worldview that comes with sufi'sm? If you know what I mean?
No I mean Jews and other minorities were targeted for death, Germans that didn't fit that description would be threatened with their and their families lives if they spoke bad of the nazi parties and hitler.
You're all a massive inspiration. We have to redouble our efforts here in the west, so that we may one day end the exploitation of African peoples and move forward to a fairer, more decent world. Solidarity from the UK!

@ChiruKingu Handling all that takes peak masculinity
I never would've the courage or support to come out at 10. By being supportive and helping her be confident in who she is you're the biggest protective factor that she'll have in her life as a young LGBT person. You must have a great relationship with her to have seen that she was struggling and to have her be able to confide in you. More kids need moms like you!  Also you might consider taking her to pride, she's young but pride (like the big parades) is for everyone and lots of LGBT families/Ally's go and bring their kids.

@MissComprehend I was told that married women and women with partners have sexual duties Im like well.. Even My mom (God bless her) took me for "the talk" when I first had my serious boyfreind
My two closest friends. I knew they'd be accepting and one of them was openly bi as well. I'm still not out to anyone else yet. I know they'll be accepting but I just haven't felt the need to tell them. And funny story, it turns out the other friend is bi or at least somewhere towards the middle of the Kinsey scale. So I guess LGBT magnetism is a real thing?
@elzeide @trulybclark @kaplanrobbie @se4realhinton I don't know the specific details of how the organizers of a single march in a single city were chosen.

>Another said homosexuality is "not acceptable for us lot". The crawl back into whichever shit-hole you dragged yourself out of.
Ex-Muslim here too. Yeah you are right, there are many good things that can be taken from Muhammad.
My general advice is to not come out untill you know you are safe. Always prioritize your own health above coming out. If it's safe to come out, start small. Get some one on your side first. Maybe a good friend of yours who can then be there for you to support you while you come out to the rest of your friends/family. Anyway, I wish you the best of luck! You are an amazing human being and I love you!! You are valid and you got this!!!

My biggest regret in college (I just graduated) was not finding queer friends that were specifically women. I know several cis gay men and unfortunately we rarely relate to one another. I never really found queer friends in college and it's one of my biggest regrets. That being said, I did witness a girl I know make a lot of friends through my university's twitter crowd. She basically tweeted "who wants to be in my queer girl squad" and that worked for her! People started messaging her to hangout!
Vickie Millwood  Well I personally don't believe in all that.  But what I do believe in are ideas. Ideas that this Christian spoke about, that inspired millions, and the ideas that are still prevalent to this day.
Men are still ten times more likely to die on the job. As we get more "equality", I don't see women taking dangerous jobs from men. Women are taking safe jobs from men so even more men will die on the job. If we were to have a another Vietnam (60,000 killed), 97% will be men. Men die earlier than women, but spending on woman's healthcare research (breast, ovarian cancer etc.) is four (4) times greater than the sending on mens healthcare research (prostate, testicular cancer etc.). The list goes on.

Not really an "experience" but there's a trans bellhop and whenever I see her it makes me smile and appreciate the fact that Disney is 100% fine with trans people, and that the world in general is more accepting of LGBT+ individuals. Apparently she's a really nice person too.

She says she'd rather me be a happy woman, rather than a miserable man, or dead, it'll just be hard for her. We're also both Christians, and come from conservative backgrounds, so it's like a double culture shock. On top of that, her brother just came out as gay (thanks to me coming out as trans I guess) and she's having a rough time of it. She kind of saw him coming out, and wasn't surprised, but I'm a shock.

It's not your decision. If a woman doesn't want to carry her rapist's offspring or die in childbirth, that's fine.
The part that finally got to me was this: >while you don't dislike your current gender, you still experience euphoria from dressing like/being called a different gender. That's basically exactly how I feel right now. I am fine being male, having a penis and everything (but I hate having body hair), yet at the same time, when I imagine being treated like a girl, or dressing up like one, I have that tingly feeling, that sense that while I'm satisfied now, I'd be happier like that.

It's just really pointless and insulting to people who actually experience racism by implying our society is in need of a reminder that being a white person is okay. Because I doubt one genuine look at history would leave anyone wondering if "being white" in the U.S. will be perceived as a problem.  The very concept of on a personal level being okay with the fact you were born with the skin color you were born with is of course not racist. But the statement just makes it seem like white people are at risk to become some sort of outcasts.

It felt a little wierd and at the end I felt disappointed. Then I wondered why. Cause there was no discussion beginned?...But then there are, you can come up with the conclusion you want. Mine is that it made me think about how even Black people are biased toward a lighter skin and not just to lighten the burden of discrimination on their kids. Its also found more beautiful. Really Racism/ discrimination of ones race goes so deep that even the people that are targetted by it end up to kind of have that thinking too toward each other.

Asian parents will work their ass off the send their kids to college instill them with good ethics but they aren't always the best at showing or saying love outright.  There's many pros and cons to the ways different cultures raise their kids and I just wanted to say no one group is all good or all bad.

Just to add on to your post the idea that the USA hates representative democracy for Muslims needs to contend with several recent examples of the US establishing, or attempting to, representative democracy in Afghanistan, Bosnia, Kosovo, and even Iraq. While you can argue whether Iraq was better or worse under Saddam or w/e they are currently an independent democracy which acts in it's own interests, even when they don't align with the USA. Such as playing hardball with their oil contracts and only leasing them instead of selling them (which the USA wanted them to do).
No, the chances of a muslim shooting you in America is almost nil. There are over 50K gun deaths every year christian USA. We should be focusing our attention on Christians and less on peace loving Muslims.
They are only one sex. Use sex and gender appropriately.
It takes belief in false morality to commit atrocities. Those who believe in the false morality of anti-abortion, anti-gay religions are primed for authoritarianism. They use their beliefs to prop themselves up as superior to others. They excuse all transgressions made by hose who share their beliefs. That is how they excuse the obvious and undeniable immorality of Trump. It is only a small step from there to dehumanizing others and committing genocidal acts like separating migrant children from their parents or ignoring the threat of climate change.

My dad is also a Caucasian Jew/Mountain jew , and he won't identify as Azeri. They left in the '90s but he told me that they were always considered just Jews as their nationality by other people and themselves. In the Caucasus, they lived close together. Even here in New York, they were able to form a community. Marriages usually also stayed within the community, however, overtime some married other groups. But yes, it's mostly because of the religion and how others even viewed them. When you ask them what they are, they will say Caucasian Jews and come from Azerbaijan.

Thats based on a hadith where the guy killed 150 people. Was on his way to ask about allah, died in the desert. Allah decreed for the distance he traveled to the city to ask about forgiveness, if it was half he was forgiven. He then moved the earth to skew the measurement. I believe this was from muhammad himself. Still if the people he killed were pagans or christians or jews, we are the worst of creatures according to the quran and hell will be our dwelling.
Zakat, or charity, is the 'Third Pillar of Islam', and is a major fundamental part of teaching and practice. Being charitable and providing for the needy are important features of the Muslim character.

Coming out doesn't have to mean coming out to everyone. You can come out to your parents without being out to the rest of your family. You can come out to random strangers in queer places without telling your parents (in fact, that's what coming out used to mean! Introducing yourself to the community!) Take it slow. Not telling everyone doesn't mean you're 'fake' or ashamed of yourself

Men are still ten times more likely to die on the job. As we get more "equality", I don't see women taking dangerous jobs from men. Women are taking safe jobs from men so even more men will die on the job. If we were to have a another Vietnam (60,000 killed), 97% will be men. Men die earlier than women, but spending on woman's healthcare research (breast, ovarian cancer etc.) is four (4) times greater than the sending on mens healthcare research (prostate, testicular cancer etc.). The list goes on.
It's good to be comfortable in your own body! You're who you choose to be, and if you're trans that's cool and if you're cis that's cool too.

It's just really pointless and insulting to people who actually experience racism by implying our society is in need of a reminder that being a white person is okay. Because I doubt one genuine look at history would leave anyone wondering if "being white" in the U.S. will be perceived as a problem.  The very concept of on a personal level being okay with the fact you were born with the skin color you were born with is of course not racist. But the statement just makes it seem like white people are at risk to become some sort of outcasts.

So many people view sexuality as if it's a choice you make. I wish everyone would stop wasting so much time and energy hating and trying to punish others simply for being themselves. I'm sorry it went like that with your grandma, but so glad your parents are supportive of you; I'm sure it was a really scary to come out to your family, and you are so very brave to do so. Good luck in the future, and hopefully your grandma decides to rethink her position and come around!

"Coming out" is becoming less and less of a thing with each passing year, which is great. No one should have to be worry about repercussions -- be it family, friends, work -- because of who they love. The only profession where it still seems to be somewhat taboo is male professional sports. And even those walls are slowly coming down.
Thank you for this! I'm still working on defining my sexuality, whether I'm bi or pan, and I worry that it won't be "right" when I finally come out to family and friends. But this kinda helped me clarify that I'm more bi. And it gave a handy way of explaining it to others who may not know. Thanks!

You phrased that in a way that was particularly touching to me, even though I have felt the same way. My father was raised by very strict adventists who, as I have examined my grandmother, seem to put more emphasis on simply following human made doctrine and perceived notions rather than the message of love in Jesus Christ. My father is still a follower, but it makes me wonder how much stronger his relationship with Christ could have been if he didn't have so many false teaching angrily forced upon him.

Have she spoken to her parents regarding the lgbt subject? Not meaning coming out but the topic itself. I know of a Muslim friend that has a non binary (uncle/auntie), it's frowned upon within the country and culture but the family does accept them for who they are. And they are a religious family. In saying that, I do understand that its different case by case
I like the idea of "believing in" gay marriage.
I hope this family finds the lord and be sex lord made them before they die God Bless  is root to all evil.

But the statement just makes it seem like white people are at risk to become some sort of outcasts.

What is the benefit of being part of the community? I don't understand why being a recognized part of lgbt+ is so important to people.

Add another to the minority. ;-) I'd say yes, CD people can be under the transgender umbrella. I say that as people can struggle with their gender and just because we're not 'dressed up', it didn't mean the feelings around gender - and how it doesn't quite feel right - go away. I'd rather have an umbrella term - like Trans (or transgender) - that can include all of us. I think there are so many outside the community who want to push us back into the shadows or drive us apart.

Had one guy in Turkey said I don't look like I'm from America. If anything, they may ask some ignorant-ish questions but nothing malicious.

I hope Canada takes no role in the United states border crisis. They can handle their own mess, we have a legal system that needs to be followed and they are able to seek asylum through routs that are already in place. Putting thousands of people to the front of the line because it's a hot topic right now only undermines our system and is completely unfair to the people seeking refuge from African countries and well as people fleeing war in the middle east. We shouldn't be taking economic refugees from Latin America when there are people running from genocide elsewhere.

It takes belief in false morality to commit atrocities. Those who believe in the false morality of anti-abortion, anti-gay religions are primed for authoritarianism. They use their beliefs to prop themselves up as superior to others. They excuse all transgressions made by hose who share their beliefs. That is how they excuse the obvious and undeniable immorality of Trump. It is only a small step from there to dehumanizing others and committing genocidal acts like separating migrant children from their parents or ignoring the threat of climate change.

I never would've the courage or support to come out at 10. By being supportive and helping her be confident in who she is you're the biggest protective factor that she'll have in her life as a young LGBT person. You must have a great relationship with her to have seen that she was struggling and to have her be able to confide in you. More kids need moms like you!  Also you might consider taking her to pride, she's young but pride (like the big parades) is for everyone and lots of LGBT families/Ally's go and bring their kids.

Thanks for your response. You have a good point that my own question could be equally applied to cis-gendered. As a male myself I hate many aspects of the male gender role, but I still want to be male and see myself as such.

Similar to my grandparents lesbian friends on Long Island in the sixties... one was a NYC judge and the other a bit of a bohemian. They often watched my mom and her siblings and were favorites in the neighborhood, but no one ever addressed their sexuality, just called them spinster friends.  Sad that gay couples couldn't be more open, but good that they weren't ostracized and could be active community members in some places.  It's heartening to know my grandparents loved them so much and gave me some solace as a teen before coming out to them.

I had long had issues with Pentecostal doctrines and had left quite a few years before I became Orthodox. It wasn't history that brought me to become Orthodox- though things did click when I read about it. It was the Eucharist. I had experienced the presence of God while communion was going on in an Orthodox parish I was visiting. I had never experienced anything even remotely like it before. I immediately knew I had to convert.
But what about all the apostates that are struck dumb like in the scripturesOH WAIT
Yeah, because redpillers have experienced that women happen to use concepts like "True Intimacy (TM)" or Twu Wuv or whatever as a tool to gaslight men into accepting why they're basically DBR'd: "The fact that I only have sex once a month with you shows that I value you and our relationship so much more than my past fuckbuddies", and bluepilled guys gobble it up.

Hey, thanks for sharing that. I feel you. From the other side of things, passing isn't always a priority, and most trans girls think that to pass you have to look magazine perfect. Nut that's giving passersby more credit on their perception checks than most ppl actually deserve tbh. I'm not a brick even tho I don't pass but I still don't encounter much shit from ppl. Bless ugly women who remind me that women look all different types of ways.  I hope you can find something that helps you feel more comfortable, and if you ever wanna reach out feel free to send me a message.

It's just really pointless and insulting to people who actually experience racism by implying our society is in need of a reminder that being a white person is okay. Because I doubt one genuine look at history would leave anyone wondering if "being white" in the U.S. will be perceived as a problem.  The very concept of on a personal level being okay with the fact you were born with the skin color you were born with is of course not racist. But the statement just makes it seem like white people are at risk to become some sort of outcasts.
as a gay member myself, i think you're doing great. there are so many strong lgbtq people in the church who are either celibate or do end up marrying someone of the opposite sex anyway and i have never felt like that's for me. granted i'm young so that can change but i'm proud of you for trying your hardest. it's not easy to be gay and in the church and we don't have all the answers so all we can do is our best. don't beat yourself up too much, your heavenly father loves you so much

I don't honestly feel able to answer because I don't get a choice, but transition has given me a flat chest and a dick and facial hair and honestly I'm happy. Dysphoria has been difficult at times but I have been "lucky" enough to receive affirming healthcare, and I'm comfortable with being trans. I would lose so much of my experiences if I were cis that I can't say I would choose to be like that, I'd be such a different person and I like myself as I am.

Are you aware that said pussy is attached to a fully realized human being with the exact same natural rights to happiness as you? And that she does not deserve to be forced to have sex with anyone she finds undesirable?    Do you get that women have the same right to reject men that men have to reject women?    How committed are you to the belief that women are holes, rather than human beings deserving of respect?
My family did the same because many were American Indians. My Irish grandparents were hated by their English neighbors. My husband's family were German but forbade their kids from even learning the language for fear that they would be treated badly by their neighbors during WW1. Thankfully our Japanese family members lived in Hawaii where there were too many of them to be imprisoned during WW2. If you look back far enough, there will be some kind of secrets hiding back there. It's really ridiculous that people get so weird about race or color. We all bleed red.
Lots of love from India.!

Men are still ten times more likely to die on the job. As we get more "equality", I don't see women taking dangerous jobs from men. Women are taking safe jobs from men so even more men will die on the job. If we were to have a another Vietnam (60,000 killed), 97% will be men. Men die earlier than women, but spending on woman's healthcare research (breast, ovarian cancer etc.) is four (4) times greater than the sending on mens healthcare research (prostate, testicular cancer etc.). The list goes on.

I was gonna say this lol. But it seems to be regional-dependent from what I can tell (in regards to the States, I mean). Like, I'm from the South and an open-relationship is still a very rare thing to come across.    But over the West coast, they'rs downright proud of how they've "redefined the meaning of relationship", gay men especially. (I took a trip to San Fran last October and I can't tell you how many times I heard that "we've redefined it" line dropped in bars as soon as a guy realized I was southern haha.)
"insult to atheism" Funny how there's no code in atheism which states you'd go to hell if you insult it. It's always open to insults and constructive criticism. There's no staunch 'atheism' and you can take note NOW that besides atheists there are also agnostics, liberal religious,anti-theists,deists, etc here. No one can speak for another.

He was referring to her being here illegally, along with the rest of her family. He did not mention that she was married to her brother. As Americans, we must accept that different cultures have different standards. Just as Omar must accept American standards. She is free to leave. What a beautiful country.
I brought up Nikki Haley because she is of Indian descent and is married to a white guy. My preference is any women of any race that share my love of Indian culture though I'd prefer an Indian Hindu woman if any are interested in me. Obviously if I fall in love with a Hindu girl of any ethnicity I'm open to that.
Yes, it is one of man's right. Just like one of women right to get accomodation and privacy.

I did not have to work with people who converted to Orthodoxy from another faith, so I can say little. Faith is God's gift. Pray to understand and do His will.

It takes belief in false morality to commit atrocities. Those who believe in the false morality of anti-abortion, anti-gay religions are primed for authoritarianism. They use their beliefs to prop themselves up as superior to others. They excuse all transgressions made by hose who share their beliefs. That is how they excuse the obvious and undeniable immorality of Trump. It is only a small step from there to dehumanizing others and committing genocidal acts like separating migrant children from their parents or ignoring the threat of climate change.

That is a strawman. We think gender (thoughts, behaviours, desires, social roles) is largely defined by sex, but there are people where psychology and biology don't line up as expected. Like how sexual attraction is strongly correlated to biology, yet you still have gay people.

It's just really pointless and insulting to people who actually experience racism by implying our society is in need of a reminder that being a white person is okay. Because I doubt one genuine look at history would leave anyone wondering if "being white" in the U.S. will be perceived as a problem.  The very concept of on a personal level being okay with the fact you were born with the skin color you were born with is of course not racist. But the statement just makes it seem like white people are at risk to become some sort of outcasts.

Generally true, but there are indeed missionaries in many of these areas, and they do indeed teach. For example, there are senior missionaries and branches in northern Iraq, in the autonomous Kurdish regions. There are also convert baptisms and missionaries in Pakistan. India has several missions of course, and without going into detail the work inside mainland China is going swimmingly (there are protocols for missionary work there, but it is occurring quietly and legally).
Europe should also show muslims that get out of europe.

This is true, but there are times to bring it up. Bringing up that all lives matter when BLM is talking isn't very helpful just like bringing up that women have privileges that men don't when we're talking about general disadvantages for women isn't helpful. Both can easily be true and helping one group doesn't mean the other group is necessarily at fault or will be hurt.

Men are still ten times more likely to die on the job. As we get more "equality", I don't see women taking dangerous jobs from men. Women are taking safe jobs from men so even more men will die on the job. If we were to have a another Vietnam (60,000 killed), 97% will be men. Men die earlier than women, but spending on woman's healthcare research (breast, ovarian cancer etc.) is four (4) times greater than the sending on mens healthcare research (prostate, testicular cancer etc.). The list goes on.

People pointing out privileges you benefit from because of your light skin ≠ people diminishing the fact that you've experienced racism.  But there's a difference between the way dark skinned people are viewed/treated in comparison to our lighter counterparts & it's systemic.
Oh reread your post and actually your question is not that deep..! No I think how people identify is personal to them and finding a partner that loves you is a separate issue. Being a fem man is not at all being a trans woman.  If this isn't your own set of worries maybe you shouldn't concern yourself too much with it!
Its not race we should be proud of. It's CULTURE. Culture is what defines us as human beings and dictates this such as our behavior, romantic preference etc. Race just happens to be heavily related to what culture people have. Nonetheless I am grateful for your contribution to my post.

I feel like I'm too young to ask if I'm bi or pan. I want to travel out of my city bubble and meet more people (especially in the LGBTQ+ community) to truly understand if I'm bi or I'm pan. So for now I'm sticking with bi because I'm more comfortable in my current situation. :)))

That's how you do celebrate each other's accomplishments, very proud moment as a Black man of 53years old and I am not a fan of that team up North but as a Black man I understand what this means to these men to see their brother and friend to be elevated at this level.
I think that's a really accurate quote, we should feel comfortable speaking out against people with blatantly racist, anti-white male sentiments
You make us bengalis proud  its in the blood my man!
I first learned the term bisexual because of him when I was a kid back in 2003. I grew up in a super Pentecostal Christian home where LGBT did not exist, so Billie Joe being out since 1995 and letting kids like me know bi people existed was pretty life-changing. I hope I can thank him in person one day.
It's okay to be lesbian.  It's okay to be straight.  It's okay to be gay.  It's okay to be bi. It's okay to be trans.  It's okay to be you. But it's NEVER okay to use sound or drop on lured Cogs.
@Brian p some said Joseph Goebells was terrible too..who else was going to make the articulate case the Jew was vermin? He was doing his job too..great man with a nice large family..the tricks by those who did not support the facist state which wanted to include Jews, gypsies, homosexuals were disgusting politics too..those elements were purged like Trump will purge such elements today in the name citizenship..pure and clean..make Germany.. eh..I mean MAGA..
So Kai is a man who transitioned from being born a woman? But he is attracted to women..*and* men? Or just women? I'm out of the loop a bit here. Is everyone in the house bisexual to some degree? Or are some of them only interested in one gender (which would make figuring out matches a lot easier, obviously).
@hosamlovesAllah @LabourGay Ridiculous. You hate queers so you invent some ridiculous god-myth that justifies it, and you expect anyone in the world to take you seriously? Best of luck with that one, buddy... :0)
>Some incels give a lot but get nothing back   And so should be rewarded with pussy? Are you aware that said pussy is attached to a fully realized human being with the exact same natural rights to happiness as you? And that she does not deserve to be forced to have sex with anyone she finds undesirable?    Do you get that women have the same right to reject men that men have to reject women?    How committed are you to the belief that women are holes, rather than human beings deserving of respect?

I don't honestly feel able to answer because I don't get a choice, but transition has given me a flat chest and a dick and facial hair and honestly I'm happy. Dysphoria has been difficult at times but I have been "lucky" enough to receive affirming healthcare, and I'm comfortable with being trans. I would lose so much of my experiences if I were cis that I can't say I would choose to be like that, I'd be such a different person and I like myself as I am.

Nice, I've done the same thing plenty of times. The last thong I got my hands on belonged to my friends wife.

How is asking someone to use proper pronouns forcing things on you? Gender Dysphoria affects many people, and the only way to treat it is to transition. You also over exaggerate quite a bit. There isn't a big chunk. Almost no one is like how you described a "big chunk" of the community to be. Most transgender people only want to be accepted for who they are.

From 64 Event to Arab Spring, western propaganda should be responsible for all deaths in these color revolutions. It took 3 years for Middle-East people and over 20 years for Chinese people to find that they were deluded at the beginning. Luckily, the revolution in China was stopped (though it caused many citizens' deaths). But Middle-East people were not as lucky. Their society was totally disorganized ever since, and thousands times more deaths than 64 event came.

It's actually because men need to be funny to hook up with women. We train to be funny, whereas a lot of women comedians think people should laugh just because they are on stage and the audience should be supportive. If you aren't funny, we aren't going to laugh. I've heard great female comedians, but it's not hard to see why there are more male comedians. Girls don't need to be funny to have sex.

Yes, I'm bi. This was a conclusion I arrived at fairly early in my coming out, but the biphobe who helped me come out (because he wanted to date me) had me convinced I was fully gay. Learned that lesson in a miserable way - never let anybody else decide your identity for you.
Yeah there's always gonna be some level of unknown and otherness dating bi partners because there's an obvious example of your partner liking something you obviously dont have. I think it's key to remember that your partner is looking for connection first, with the logistics of how they get off follows that. Really happy for you two!

Up until a good way into the imperial age, the confession of a slave could only legally be obtained through torture. The Romans referred to the Mediterranean as Mare Nostrum, meaning 'our sea'.

It's just really pointless and insulting to people who actually experience racism by implying our society is in need of a reminder that being a white person is okay. Because I doubt one genuine look at history would leave anyone wondering if "being white" in the U.S. will be perceived as a problem.  The very concept of on a personal level being okay with the fact you were born with the skin color you were born with is of course not racist. But the statement just makes it seem like white people are at risk to become some sort of outcasts.

In 8th grade I was very confused because I k ew I liked boys but I also knew I liked girls, so I knew I wasn't straight but I wasn't gay either and I was like "What am I?". I didn't know what bisexuality was yet. Then my best friend, who has helped me through all my journey, was like, well there's this thing called bisexual and you're that, and for that I thank her very much. I always accepted myself but I was confused af.
I consider it a health condition, which has my sympathy. I can't imagine what it would be like to wish more than anything to be born the opposite sex. That has to be difficult, even though it's not in itself life threatening like cancer or a disability like blindness. This is only my speculation, but I think people generally would have a more sympathetic view of issues facing trans people if the public discourse was from a health standpoint rather than a sharply political one.

It's important to remember, though, that gender dysphoria and being transgender aren't the same thing but they're often used interchangeably. Dysphoria is the illness/condition/symptom/whatever but just being trans isn't an illness.

I feel like someone can identify as straight and just have a "one exception" (or gay and have the same thing). Since it's all a wild spectrum of feeling that we try to describe with neat little labels anyway. I guess for me, her sexuality doesn't have to change for your identity to be legitimate (though I do get what you're saying).
Even when I was Mormon she was waaaaay too Mormon for me. But clearly her content speaks to a lot of people, so good for her!

It's just really pointless and insulting to people who actually experience racism by implying our society is in need of a reminder that being a white person is okay. Because I doubt one genuine look at history would leave anyone wondering if "being white" in the U.S. will be perceived as a problem.  The very concept of on a personal level being okay with the fact you were born with the skin color you were born with is of course not racist. But the statement just makes it seem like white people are at risk to become some sort of outcasts.
Oh, I didnt know Jacob was Filipino.
To all those who still don't know exactly what there sexuality is, that is okay. There is no rush to label yourself or assign yourself to a category, when you know or want to "define" yourself, the time will come. But no matter what, just know you are loved and you matter

Trans rights are human rights
You can have a physical or sexual attraction for men without being fully gay. Sexuality is a huge spectrum. Me and my husband are both bi, but we have children and a very conventional looking life and relationship. Life isn't black and white, and you don't need to be so worried and consumed with the grey areas. Just work on being the best you possible and accepting yourself for who you are.

Well, BITD, in jolly ol', it was sometimes mortally illegal to be Catholic, and sometimes mortally illegal to be Protestant, and always mortally necessary to be one or the other. Depending, it seems, on who married whom, or wanted to. GTFO, right? So, a lot of people did. And brought their religions with them. And the right of religion being the first of the rights guaranteed in the US constitution convinced a LOT of people that religion was the shit. Happily, a Beneficent Deity invested us all with True Understanding, so we get along fine now.

You did experience the same thing as me. Might not be "same sex" stuff, but the shame and guilt Christianity places on the natural human desires to be loved and connected to others in terms of relationships and sex is very universal regardless of the gender of the person you desire those things with. I've been on both sides of the "straight" and "gay" guilt. Both suck pretty equally lol.  And thanks for the encouragement. Being more patient with myself is good advice. I wake up everyday and think "why am I not fixed yet" but like you said, it takes time.
my cousin, who got his girlfriend pregnant before marriage, commented on my post saying homosexuality is a sin. i told him the bible said those who had sex before marriage are going to hell. bokbok bitch.
Touché! I've fucked around with a lot of straight guys but NEVER in my life have any of them tried to eat my ass. Hell 98% of them didn't even want to suck my cock.
I'm generally more supportive of people who aren't part of a church per se (grew up in a catholic household) just because those people tend to be more flexible knowledge-wise. It's always seemed to me that the Catholic Church is less a church and more a political body, but each person derives their own value out of it I suppose

It's actually because men need to be funny to hook up with women. We train to be funny, whereas a lot of women comedians think people should laugh just because they are on stage and the audience should be supportive. If you aren't funny, we aren't going to laugh. I've heard great female comedians, but it's not hard to see why there are more male comedians. Girls don't need to be funny to have sex.

If someone declares they believe in Jesus, then they are not a Jew - he does not believe in our faith. It's simple. Both in Israel and across the Jewish world, there is a blanket rejection of Messianic Jews. They are ineligible to make aliya, because it is not accepted that a Jew can believe in Jesus. Therefore they are excluded from the Law of Return as people who have voluntarily converted out of Judaism. The Supreme Court ruled the Messianic Jews belief in Jesus makes them Christians, thus ineligible for citizenship. - Jerusalem Post 12/16/2017

I think that being trans has totally shaped the way I view the world and the way I connect to it. It shapes the art I make and the things I write, the way I interact with people, the way I move through life. I like being trans and deaf especially because ASL is a beautiful language and I think I can express my gender better with ASL than I ever can in english. sometimes I hate this shit but I don't think I would give it up. I don't think I'm proud of it yet either but I know I'll get there. picking my own name was also pretty dope.

I think that one issue is where you live and the level of homophobia. There are, of course, gay men and women everywhere, but when it is not safe people conceal. My understanding from your previous posts is that there are no LGBT organizations that you are aware of near where you live. Do I understand that right? Are there any gay bars, or at least gay friendly bars in your city? If so, drop in, have a beer and chat up the bartender. Come back a few times. Have conversations. Get to know a few names and faces. It is work to become known.

Women are always raped in times of war. Knowing this, many will commit suicide so their bodies are their own 'til the end. Men have no idea how fucking horrible they are to women, and women have been fooled into overlooking this shitty behavior.

I can totally relate to this, I spent some weeks backpacking in Europe and the best part was all the people I got to meet and hang out with. The topic of being gay came out organically with a few of them but over all it wasn't relevant most of the time, which was a break from it being so back home.  Like others who have commented here I live in a conservative country and I feel it gets in the way of most guys trusting and opening up to me. It would be nice to meet guys at home like the ones I met while traveling but it's been rare.

Which kind of curls are you talking? The beautiful 3C that is glorify by the media or the short 4c? Black girls have different type of curls. That is why to protect them we wear protective styles. From braids to wigs, we wear them to protect our natural hair and also to try different styles without damaging our natural hair. On Monday I an silky straight 20inches hair and on Tuesday a big afro. Hair is a way to express ourselves. I'm sorry black women having fun with their hair makes you sad.

But haven't women and colored actors acted in remakes which were originally made cult movies around white actors or men. Granted, a lot of them were horrific (ghostbusters), but the point is that Hollywood has done its fair share and I don't think an actor should have to punished because of a sense of pseudo-moralizing disguised by moral outrage.

Penises are kinda neat and sex physically feels good. The social/interpersonal aspect is a whole other matter, however. They're nice to look at sometimes. Often, actually.  When they do something cute, and it's weirdly endearing, and it makes me happy inside. I suppose this one is specific to moids I'm crushing on/attractive to but guys being cute is really really nice  I like that compared to vast majority of men, depending on the day, how I feel about myself/am dressed etc I feel kind of feminine next to them.

Yeah, bizarrely there was a girl at my school who's parents where from Hong Kong, moved to Texas where she was born then moved to England when she was in her teens. Managed to be both the only ethnically Asian person in my year (for most of it) and the only American in the school. Her accent was super cool, always surprised people the first time they heard her speak.
I have listened deeply to Ravi back when I was christian.  I would also like to say that I have overcome many emotional and personal barriers within my life, many dealing with how people treat the lgbtq+ community. We each have our own journey filled with obstacles, and I'm still going. I do, however, believe that breaking free of the church and finding out myself was part of those obstacles. I can finally live how I was born without hating myself.

I like being trans and deaf especially because ASL is a beautiful language and I think I can express my gender better with ASL than I ever can in english. sometimes I hate this shit but I don't think I would give it up. I don't think I'm proud of it yet either but I know I'll get there. picking my own name was also pretty dope.

I think this is any form of Christianity. Not exclusive to Church of Christ. It's already established in euro countries, so you will have little room to bring in new sects.  Africa is a stronghold for many forms of Christianity. Catholicism is very successful there. Japanese are typically atheistic and not very religious anyway.

It's just really pointless and insulting to people who actually experience racism by implying our society is in need of a reminder that being a white person is okay. Because I doubt one genuine look at history would leave anyone wondering if "being white" in the U.S. will be perceived as a problem.  The very concept of on a personal level being okay with the fact you were born with the skin color you were born with is of course not racist. But the statement just makes it seem like white people are at risk to become some sort of outcasts.

Well, BITD, in jolly ol', it was sometimes mortally illegal to be Catholic, and sometimes mortally illegal to be Protestant, and always mortally necessary to be one or the other. Depending, it seems, on who married whom, or wanted to. GTFO, right? So, a lot of people did. And brought their religions with them. And the right of religion being the first of the rights guaranteed in the US constitution convinced a LOT of people that religion was the shit. Happily, a Beneficent Deity invested us all with True Understanding, so we get along fine now.

His advice isn't exclusively for males. It resonates the most with males and I don't see that as a bad thing unlike many of his detractors. He basically wants people to be the best version of themselves and take personal responsibility.  I disagree that feminism is identify politics. It depends on the feminist and their particular brand of feminism. If group identify is more important than the individual then they are engaging in identity politics.

It actually definitely is.

If the Census accurately reflected the amount of Christians, and most of those Christians went to church, then they'd be lined around the block at every church.

He's saying that the tenets of religion that focus on treating others with kindness, and not taking advantage of others are a good basis.  I saw it stated recently that the differences between Catholicism and Protestantism are a big cause for concern, at least in the US. Catholics teach that not only your belief in god is necessary, but also your actions on earth, to get into heaven. So they also focus on kindness toward others. For Protestants, only the belief and acceptance of god is necessary, so taking advantage of others isn't frowned upon.

You have already said that even if there was 100% proof that trans women had no advantage over cis women then you still wouldn't accept trans women in women's sport so you're not really being rational on this topic. Meanwhile back in the world that I live in, there are no trans women who are world champions of their sport, no trans women who hold a world record in any event, no trans women that are Olympic medalists, in fact so far no trans women that even made an Olympic team. That doesn't align with your assumption that a penis magically gives you sporting prowess.

@EllaNeshia_ I'm not overlooking racism. I hate racism just as anyone else does. Yes it's an issue and will forever be an issue. It's just crazy how nothing has to be said about the color of anyone's skin, but it be brought up regardless. Yes, I hate that and I wish it'd stop. Everyone is
Why did I click on your profile? You gave no source anyway, you just are a hateful human being. Good grief. You have been given sources by others disproving your statements, but no you didn't, once you cited the hatesub GC, that is used only to missrepresent Transgender people and to deny their existence

>Some incels give a lot but get nothing back   And so should be rewarded with pussy? Are you aware that said pussy is attached to a fully realized human being with the exact same natural rights to happiness as you? And that she does not deserve to be forced to have sex with anyone she finds undesirable?    Do you get that women have the same right to reject men that men have to reject women?    How committed are you to the belief that women are holes, rather than human beings deserving of respect?

It's just really pointless and insulting to people who actually experience racism by implying our society is in need of a reminder that being a white person is okay. Because I doubt one genuine look at history would leave anyone wondering if "being white" in the U.S. will be perceived as a problem.  The very concept of on a personal level being okay with the fact you were born with the skin color you were born with is of course not racist. But the statement just makes it seem like white people are at risk to become some sort of outcasts.

i think i know what you mean. i'm also an afab nonbinary person. i see myself as a feminine boy. i feel like i should have been born with male anatomy... but i'm also pretty girly. that being said i want to be read as male so i'm taking testosterone and getting top surgery soon. my ultimate goal is to be able to wear a dress and for people to still see me as a guy. also, its ok to want to keep your chest the way it is!!! if you wanna do some sort of "partial transition" that's valid!! you just need to think about what would make you feel the most comfortable.

For what it's worth, I don't think it necessary to through any kind of "de-baptizing". Many of us identified as Christian and were baptized as babies (something we could not consent to). The gods do not hold our past religious views against us, especially since you seem to be on the right path now.

My wife did RCIA and I was her sponsor. I was a bit disappointed in the RCIA program in terms of how it barely touched the surface of Catholicism. Meanwhile, most of the candidates were really thirsty to get into more depth. I think it was a huge missed opportunity. So I would like to let you know to plan on pursuing your curiosity and search for truth without relying on RCIA to bring this to you. Finally, welcome to the Catholic Church. It's a rich, seemingly complex thing that you are embracing.

Yep. Stop making laws specific to Race. Or, racism will never die. I'm smarter than 2 members of the Supreme Court!  wow!
Y'know, I'm beginning to suspect these laws are about controlling women's sex lives and not about protecting the unborn. Crazy, I know.
Hey man I wish you the very best with your endeavours to pursue and eventually consummate with a thicc white girl. It's not something everyone can do but if your still young you have hope.

I loved this movie. Octavia Spencer's acting was superb. It really spoke to the unique alienation of a Black woman in the world in general but especially in predominately Caucasian settings - being belittled at work, being forced into a maternal role regardless of the circumstances, not being seen as a viable romantic partner, being isolated from social groups while Black men are able to "fit in" by conforming to stereotypes of coolness, athleticism, and sexual prowess, and being forced to rear children alone. Very unique perspective for a horror movie.

It's actually because men need to be funny to hook up with women. We train to be funny, whereas a lot of women comedians think people should laugh just because they are on stage and the audience should be supportive. If you aren't funny, we aren't going to laugh. I've heard great female comedians, but it's not hard to see why there are more male comedians. Girls don't need to be funny to have sex.

"insult to atheism" Funny how there's no code in atheism which states you'd go to hell if you insult it. It's always open to insults and constructive criticism. There's no staunch 'atheism' and you can take note NOW that besides atheists there are also agnostics, liberal religious,anti-theists,deists, etc here. No one can speak for another.

I'm a minority that speaks mandarin, but when there's other minorities in the group I always make sure that they get to sing their songs of choice. English usually, but I've had some nice Malay songs sung too. It's not just about "letting them sing", it's also being supportive when they are singing. I mean - if a Chinese person in a group of White dudes insisted on singing a Mandarin song, and while he/she is singing, the white people all just sulk in the corner and look bored - who on earth wants to put up with that sort of vibes at KTV.

I just used Lebanon as an example because it's relatively stable right now, as far as Middle Eastern countries go. Officially, Lebanon is a Christian country anyhow. A lot could change in Lebanon, especially if there is a war with Iran or the situation gets more tense with Israel. But granted, a lot can change anywhere.  The bottom line is, Armenia needs the Diaspora just as much as the Diaspora needs Armenia, if not more. That's the point that I was making. Without the Diaspora, Armenia as a country would be like Moldova.

Also I would appreciate if you didn't tell more who or what I'm allowed to defend. I can and will defend Donald Trump if I so wish.

That makes sense tbh, I do already feel somewhat more connected and decent in myself just by letting the truth out.

Mental how being trans seems easier than being your birth sex and gay. Logically no but yeah. Thank you so much
It's fine to be upset. Rejection and sexual frustration are upsetting, and you should be allowed to vent your frustrations in a constructive, supportive environment.  It is NOT fine to advocate, threaten, or condone rape. If you think women deserve to be raped because you haven't found someone willing to let you flail pathetically around on them for 43 seconds, then I think you deserve to cry alone, rotting in your semen encrusted underwear alone, until you die. Alone.

Come out. Not living your truth has got to be so draining. If your family doesn't accept it at some point then it's their loss. There's nothing wrong with being gay. One of my best friends is First generation Korean and his family had a lot of trouble with it at first. After a couple years they came around. I think it basically came down to his dad missing him and telling the wife she had better figure out how to get over it.

Ya know, there is no feeling more universally bisexual than self-consciousness over whether you're actually bi. Or bi enough. Or bi enough to fit in in the LGBT community. Or whether you can be LGBT in a "straight" relationship. Or whether you're actually just an imposter. Or... I could go on and on.  Just know that these feelings are 100% extremely common in bi people. I can relate to all this. I know it's easier said than done, but try not to let these feelings get to you too much. You're bi and you belong in the LGBT+ community as much as any other LGBT+ person. :)
For example, the Greek Orthodox have a chant to God called "Agios O Theos." Theos was a Greek term for the uncreated cause of the universe. A little different then the modern day western notion of a personal creator god, but similar. The chants in Orthodoxy, the Liturgy, the prayer to the saints and of course to Mary who they called (Theotokos) which is Mother of God in greek. This is all from Greek paganism. I'm not knocking it, I love Orthodoxy but it's just a simple fact. I'd argue that more modern forms of Protestantism aren't nearly as pagan.

I have really been thinking about just coming out to her, because then she knows I am a lesbian and that kind of puts the ball in her court. If that makes sense. I mean honestly there is no reason why I wouldn't come out to her. She is one of the most progressive and supportive open minded people I know. It's just no matter what, coming out is a super scary thing.
Coming out is something very intimate. It means sharing a very personal fact about yourself with people. Only you should decide who gets to know you like that. If you think someone doesn't deserve to have this kind of information or you fear what they might do with it then you have no obligation to tell them. However you might be missing out on a very profound and supportive friendship and I think that friends and allies are crucial to a happy life as a gay person.  In the end the choice is yours to make. I hope I could help. You'll find your way. We all will.

It takes belief in false morality to commit atrocities. Those who believe in the false morality of anti-abortion, anti-gay religions are primed for authoritarianism. They use their beliefs to prop themselves up as superior to others. They excuse all transgressions made by hose who share their beliefs. That is how they excuse the obvious and undeniable immorality of Trump. It is only a small step from there to dehumanizing others and committing genocidal acts like separating migrant children from their parents or ignoring the threat of climate change.

We should rather see what the LGBTQ+ community did in India. They were an organic movement. They were also successfull.
Why that lady say so called "white privileged." When I was growing up in New York City, most of the White kids did cray things almost more than Black kids. If a White kid is stopped by police, they will get 10 times be vetted less than a Black kid.  Overall, Senator Gillbrand made a valid point. I appreciate it

Ain't legal yet in Georgia, but we've got a bill going through this September and could really use your support in helping to make sure straight white men like me can legally marry internet Youtube videos under 30 seconds. Right now the time limit for legal marriage is 1:30, but love knows no number.
High school student here. Gay but not out. Family would be cool with it if I were out. So I understand what you mean. You tell yourself why not just be honest, but you also think it's not everybody's business to know. And you think about what they're gona ask you. Like what type of gay stuff u wanna do.  I'm gonna come out after high school. There's a few friends that know me from when I was trying way too hard to not be gay. It would be too weird. But I totally get why you wouldn't. Good luck.

Type is super important. I prefer girls who are obviously hot, shorter than me, petite but with tits, and usually darker hair. Race doesn't matter, but I prefer tan girls. That's what I'm attracted to. That's what I like.    If a girl is a little bigger and a little taller? Yeah, I might be attracted to her as well. But she's not my main type. There are always exceptions.   And that's just on looks... Nothing to do with personality. That's a whole other thing... and yes, there's a type for that too.
It's actually because men need to be funny to hook up with women. We train to be funny, whereas a lot of women comedians think people should laugh just because they are on stage and the audience should be supportive. If you aren't funny, we aren't going to laugh. I've heard great female comedians, but it's not hard to see why there are more male comedians. Girls don't need to be funny to have sex.
Not a privilege exactly. Just a recognition that our beliefs are in line enough that sacraments can be shared.  And no, just because a denomination isn't isn't in fellowship doesn't mean they're not thought of a Christian.

I'm so sorry you had to go through that, it is so painful when the people most close to you just turn their backs like that. I'm 18 and I came out as bi and let's just say my mom doesn't approve.. I know what you're going through. Remember that what your parents think don't matter the slightest. And I'm an atheist, but if there is a God I'm sure He loves you exactly as you are. You are not broken or ill or something that needs to be changed. As you grow up you will find people who will love you exactly as you are.

oh i know, that's the point. thankfully my girlfriend was fine with my transition but not all trans people are so fortunate and it's really not anyone's obligation. I think the act of asking someone "hey if i transitioned would you still love me" and expecting them to just say yes is really making light of what transitioning actually is, what's involved, etc etc and so on

\>and living an orthodox Jewish life ​ Even for someone born and raised Jewish, it's very, very, hard to live an Orthodox jewish life outside a Jewish community. Even Shluchim (the Chabad Rabbis who open Chabad Houses) who are Rabbis, went through years of Rabbinical school, have a religious family "back home" and have special infrastructure helping them out talk how hard it is to live an Orthodox life all on their own. So while you can talk to your local Chabad house, you're probably going to have to move to a more established community before a Rabbinical court will take on the case.

So I'm bi but I feel this subreddit is still somewhat relevant to me, but heres my thoughts.  I myself wear band tees and other stuff that isnt the usual LGBT associated attire, sometimes I do but not often. But I've hardly ever had issues out at gay bars or with my gay friends.   Some have asked why but most people dont really care I think. But you'll always have haters no matter how you dress. Just do you and dress how you want, not for others approval
I'm sorry you're struggling and feeling invalidated. People can be so unsupportive and cruel. My kid has many LGBTQ friends who are feeling the way you are because of unsupportive people.

You completely missed it, my man. A Porsche - Really! You and I both know there will be people who will earn more than others, but that doesn't one better than the other. Again, you missed it. Identity politics - Really? That's, my point. People should not be identified by color, but as Americans or citizens - whatever suits you. We're saying the same thing. WOW!!! Remove the attitude and maybe we can move forward as CITIZENS or AMERICANS - whatever suits you. At least we're having the conversation. This is real conversation. Keep it coming!
Men are still ten times more likely to die on the job. As we get more "equality", I don't see women taking dangerous jobs from men. Women are taking safe jobs from men so even more men will die on the job. If we were to have a another Vietnam (60,000 killed), 97% will be men. Men die earlier than women, but spending on woman's healthcare research (breast, ovarian cancer etc.) is four (4) times greater than the sending on mens healthcare research (prostate, testicular cancer etc.). The list goes on.

To be honest this raises a good point about how little americans care for social justice outside of African-Americans. Native Americans are the most disadvantaged people in this country in so many ways but get only a fraction of the attention that African-Americans get. I'm not saying African-Americans should get less attention but we really need to take a step back and talk about Native American in a new context and on a new timeline.

Don't even know why I'm so hyped up for hari raya when I don't even consider myself a believer. But I enjoy meeting and catching up with these extended relatives on a yearly or whenever someone gets married basis. The truth is, if I were to ever out myself, they'd probably throw me in front of the mrt for being a murtad ha ha ha. Don't even know why I care so much about them. What's culture, what's religion.

Despite being from a southern conservative background, they respect my partner's gender identity and pronouns, even if they don't fully "get it". It's a nice reminder of how lovely humanity can be :)

Exactly, that's what's so annoying. Reverse the sexes and you'd reverse their reactions. How you get from "she abandoned her family with no notice" to "pity her and he needs to change"?? The only way to get there is to have a blind mentality that women are the victims always and men need to change always. It's how the got the Duluth model.

I don't think that's a bad way to look at it. But if you would say "all people under 6 feet should not be allowed to be politicians" you can argue that it's not discriminating on gender since it's just an objective measure. But in practice it is, since women are generally shorter than men. Same goes for physical prowess, which is why I'm not changing my view for now.

It actually definitely is. Have a look at the Australian Census for how many people claim to be Christian 52% (Catholic another 21%), and then try to apply that percentage to church attendance in your churches. If the Census accurately reflected the amount of Christians, and most of those Christians went to church, then they'd be lined around the block at every church.

You don't speak for the minorities and we don't speak for them either. We only speak for our own and on our own opinions. If we are offended and you're not, you don't have the right to say "we're overreacting".
Accept that you are a person who wants to be a girl and keep it moving. Surgery and hormones won't change that, but there are plenty of people who will love you for embracing yourself.
It's weird to be proud about something over which you have no control. The "pride" of minorities is more of an "I'm not ashamed". It's a response to those that ridiculed and oppressed them. Being proud of it, like you are proud of an accomplishment, would be weird.
I love that you enjoy being trans.

>Besides, companies trying to keep on top of diversity isn't necessarily a bad thing in my eyes. Non-whites, women and sexual minorities are underrepresented in just about every industry in the first world and not by coincidence, hiring biases exist and due to lack of opportunities it's tougher to break in for those with biases against them. Plus different backgrounds add different experience and ideas to the company, so it's healthy for them too. Forced representation still isn't the solution. There should be equality of opportunity, not of outcome.
I'm a white American so maybe my perspective is a little off, it kinda seems like a majority of black Americans have forgiven a majority of White Americans. Like we're in that stage where we joke about each other cause that's the way we've been doing it. Of course there will always be those that can't forgive. And there will always be those who are too awful to be forgiven. But it's at the stage where both sides don't have to be sides at all.

The only issue I have, which isn't really an issue just an observation and opinion, is the rights that gays/bis fight for are completely different for what trans fight for. Sexual Attraction and self identity are so different. One wants their marriage, adoption etc recognized. The other wants their gender and name recognized. I completely support trans people and their right to be themselves. But it doesn't go hand in hand with what gays are fighting for. Otherwise we'd have just one big civil rights group combined with race, age, handicaps, etc
For many people it is not about religious belief, but about tradition. I know plenty of straight couples that don't believe in god, yet they married in a religious ceremony because it is the tradition and they wanted to follow it. There are other times to discuss religion other than when people are celebrating their love.
Aro/ace people are 100% welcome and included in the Pride rainbow! Be out and proud!  I know in my city there has been a lot of shit by a few loud queer folks putting down others who don't present outwardly queer (bi, pan, ace, trans, non binary, and on) . I'm pan and poly but am currently in a straight passing relationship and have gotten shit for this by certain queer folks. But move past any haters who don't recognize that being part of a pride event is more than just presenting queer. You're part too!

The fact you said to them they were BSing their support, you might want to apologise for, some of them may be closeted or genuinely passionate about these things. I've said edgy memes about gay people as a bi person, but I still care a lot about their rights.  I also think that we should be more open and accepting about people's preferences in BDSM and such as long as it's consensual.

Now I realize maybe talking to guys was easy because I wasn't super into them? I'm really confused, to be honest, but when a woman strikes up a conversation with me (and it feels even slightly flirty) I turn into a giggly trying-to-be-charming mess. So I get this. Hard.
